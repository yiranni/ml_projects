      " nasa study debunks part of global warming nasa sees arctic ocean circulation do an about - face november 13 2007 pasadena calif a team of nasa and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in arctic ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade - long time scales the results suggest not all the large changes seen in arctic climate in recent years are a result of long - term trends associated with global warming the team led by james morison of the university of washington polar science center applied physics laboratory seattle used data from an earth - observing satellite and from deep - sea pressure gauges to monitor arctic ocean circulation from 2002 to 2006 they measured changes in the weight of columns of arctic ocean water from the surface to the ocean bottom that weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean surface and its salinity a saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt the very precise deep - sea gauges were developed with help from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the satellite is nasa gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the team of scientists found a 10 - millibar decrease in water pressure at the bottom of the ocean at the north pole between 2002 and 2006 equal to removing the weight of 10 centimeters four inches of water from the ocean the distribution and size of the decrease suggest that arctic ocean circulation changed from the counterclockwise pattern it exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern that was dominant prior to 1990 reporting in geophysical research letters the authors attribute the reversal to a weakened arctic oscillation a major atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere the weakening reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the north pole decreasing its weight and changing its circulation our study confirms many changes seen in upper arctic ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature rather than trends caused by global warming said morison while some 1990s climate trends such as declines in arctic sea ice extent have continued these results suggest at least for the wet part of the arctic the arctic ocean circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s he added the arctic oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970 but then varied on more or less decadal time scales with signs of an underlying upward trend until the late 1990s when it again stabilized during its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s the arctic environment changed markedly with the upper arctic ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the arctic morison said data gathered by grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short - lived the ocean circulation changes can be the newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level the winter of 2006 - 2007 was another high arctic oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum he said it is too early to say but it looks as though the arctic ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again morison cautioned that while the recent decadal - scale changes in the circulation of the arctic ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming most climate models predict the arctic oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future the events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world he said grace monitors tiny month - to - month changes in earth gravity field caused primarily by the movement of water in earth land ocean ice and atmosphere reservoirs as such it can infer changes in the weight of columns of ocean water in contrast the pressure gauges installed on the sea floor in 2005 - 2006 directly measured water pressure at the bottom of the ocean gauge data were remotely recovered during the first year of the study the close agreement between the north pole pressure gauges and grace data demonstrates grace potential for tracking world ocean circulation said study co - author john wahr of the university of colorado boulder satellite altimeters such as nasa jason are ideal for studying ocean circulation but cannot be used at earth poles due to ice cover said study co - author ron kwok of nasa jet propulsion laboratory pasadena calif our results show grace can be a powerful tool for trac\n",

      " is known as the al buraq wall to muslims i do not doubt in any way that is is known by this name by many muslims particularly some palestinian and jordanian muslims however from everything that i have read the name is of rather recent provenance and was never known as such among muslims until the foundation of modern israel if memory serves it did not really have any circulation until the last two decades or so from the obscure claims of mujir al would in that the buraq was left there when mohammad ascended to paradise which itself is a legend derived from sahih al bukhari the provenance of the hadith itself being regarded by some as an addition of a later editor that of little relevance here though i see this has been mentioned on the talk page already in passing and i do not advocate any necessity of removing it however the attribution itself is sixteenth century and actual naming of it as the al buraq wall is incredibly recent i think we should at the very least clarify this add another source aside from an obviously politically motivated fatwa for the name and perhaps move it somewhere besides the lead so we can elaborate on all of this i just skimmed it but i am not even sure the fatwa actually names it as such aside from the title nevermind it does for all i know it may itself be the origin of the name with this article helping to disseminate it since this like every jerusalem - related article is contentious i thought it best to get some discussion before i did anything yes its a point of contention see above it is discussed both in the lead subsection of the pov issues section and in the rashid khalidi section jordanian occupation 1948 1967 i was wondering from whom did the jordanian capture the old city of al - quds and the wall and why was the jordanian rule over it considered occupation while israeli rule is considered sovereignty i do not find this neutral this should be changed the answer is in the article it is referred to as the jordanian occupation because their annexation of the site was not internationally recognised hence occupation and while israel presence is also not recognised the last un resolution on the matter calls for jerusalem to be internationalised in reality israel excercises its sovreignty over the site as this matter is disputed i did want to add a section on the current legal status of the wall and suggestions mooted during peace negotiations relating to future ownership of the site but i could not find any good sources jordan exercised its sovereignty over the wall for the period they controlled it i think both should be changed to sovereignty or occupation the israeli rule is not internationally recognised either and if i am not incorrect then the western wall and old city were part of the west bank which is under occupation preceding unsigned comment added by 90 193 16 207 jerusalem is viewed differently from the west bank see positions on jerusalem and occupation of the west bank and east jerusalem by jordan this subject matter is so extensive and there are so many diverse postions on the subject i am not really qualified to determine the correct descriptions but for the sake of neutrality i believe yamanam does have a valid point even though the artricle on jordan rule calls it occupation i suggest changing both to rule which would hopefuly solve the problem yes i belive that could be an acceptable compromise i would prefer it if you did it as edits by account members are more respectable preceding unsigned comment added by 90 193 16 207 i will but why not become an editor yourself it only takes a second ! catholic bishops i am not sure but maybe the article could report about the famous incident that\n",

      " = = kolyma = = i came across the kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the kolyma gulag without reliable references etc as i believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the gulag is presented properly i have spent a few hours on this article the main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with wiki editing so i have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited additional links to the outside world and some footnoting it would be great if some of the experts on russia and russian soviet history could chip in too there has been a suggestion that the geographical page on kolyma should be separated from the article on the gulag sooner or later i think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write - up i found it interesting that of all the kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 see http bs wikipedia org wiki kolima - only two french and catalan describe the gulag poland has a special page on this i look forward to hearing from interested parties thank you for your effort in cleaning this up i had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the wikipedia in particular gross inflation of casualty numbers i think the current version is more or less ok for that use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject which is completely unacceptable in my opinion list the numbers the facts and let the reader do the math there is a little bit of that left in the current version but it probably ok now too biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible and comparison to nazi death camps the goal of the soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years something that the western countries covered in two centuries before that and to prepare for the inevitable large - scale war against countless aggressors germany the us japan etc each of whom has invaded russia just two decades prior to that to that end the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern russia and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources before getting attacked the brutality of the methods is very regrettable but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program and the benefits the country has reaped although at a very very high price drawing most of the information from solzh gulag and dissidents accounts who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth as i mentioned in the page discussion eyewitness accounts are important but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info if you record testimony of 227 inmates of abu ghraib or guant namo bay they will say that those places are hell on earth the most mercilessly terrorized particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human - run organizations and the whole us concentration camp system is evil as they would probably claim are the us themselves this alone would not make a good article on guant namo bay furthermore solzh book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70 and later soviet union to present even the second part of the 20th century in russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag which is of course a complete nonsense given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the west when it comes to these topics i long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties and then my edits get erased or lost in the never - ending stream of b s so now i only do minor corrections and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic if the arguments i presented here would help you in your further editing then good if not then wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything soviet especially in comparison to much more mellow and well - researched britannica and encarta i appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing yolanda i have been trying to put something together on yolanda of vianden as she seems to be one of luxembourg mor\n",
