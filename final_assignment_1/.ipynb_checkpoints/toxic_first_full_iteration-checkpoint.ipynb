Re: when speakers do make arguments to defend a usage, these arguments are often complicated by their reliance on false ideas on linguistic matters, such as the impression that an expression is newer than it really is. The reference only provides one example: \"\"accepted to college\"\". As far as I've read, the false ideas of usage usually pertain to expressions that have not been in the standard language for long, but in a dialect form for longer. Sometimes even a usage might die out and then be revived again, to be defended on its age. Would not it not be clearer to elaborate on \"\"linguistic matters\"\"? It is difficult to guess them solely from one example (that an expression is newer than it actually is). If the sentence were clearer, it would easier to verify it.  \"\n",

      "As I've already written above, I oppose placing Gibson's bio in the 'Anti-Semitic People' category because he vigorously denies the charge and listing him as such, without qualification, is tantamount to calling him a liar.  Anti-Semitism is a very serious and potentially libelous charge, and Wikipedia should categorically label a person as anti-Semitic only in cases where the person either admits to being anti-Semitic or admits to holding unquestionably anti-Semitic views.  Gibson has done neither and in fact vigorously denies both charges.  I do, however, sympathize with people who continue to add the 'anti-Semitic People' tag to his page. I therefore propose the creation of a new category called 'People accused of anti-Semitism'. The category would be for people who face (or have faced) substantiated charges of anti-Semitism from respected sources.  \"\"Substantiated charges\"\" would obviously mean that there was reliable evidence to support the charge (as opposed to a \"\"my best friend's roommate told me\"\" accusation), and \"\"respected sources\"\" would refer primarily to credible individuals and organizations that have an accomplished track record of identifying and combating anti-Semitism (civil rights organizations like ADL and SPLC come to mind).  This new category would allow Wikipedia to associate the anti-Semitism controversy with Gibson's article without actually leveling the charge that he is anti-Semitic.  Thoughts?  \n",

      "I actually was never carrying an ID while walking down the streets in Russia - in most cases this is not needed, and it is not compulsory by law. If you travel by train or air, you must have an ID with you - but in the USA, you also need an ID to travel by air, do not you? The police have the right to request your ID only if you are a crime suspect. I believe this is the same in the USA, isn't it? The problem is that this right is easy to abuse. In Russia, especially in bigger cities, policemen can claim you resemble someone wanted, and place you in custody until your identity is determined (but not longer than for some time which I do not remember now). They would release you from custody for a small amount of money unofficially paid to them. The problem is thus not in the law, but in the improper conduct of policemen. Identity cards or passports are compulsory in many countries, see List_of_identity_card_policies_by_country. The USA is more like an exception, actually.\n",

However the way I read  its helicopter controls to work flying with one proprotor assembly would be almost impossible. Not only do the two rotors counter torque forces, but they appear to oppose each other while maneuvering (ie to yaw right, the right prop rotor moves back, the left one forward). Could this be what some people mean by one one engine, even if it's technically incorrect?\n",

      "Philosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .\n",
      "There is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.\n",
      "Newton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.\n",
      "What is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.\n",

      " What Toptchyan wrote is that after Malkhasyants (1940, and Sarkissian's article is from March 1940, so just before it) and untill Toumanoff (1961), thus \"\"second half of the 20th century\"\", there has been no serious scholarship opposing the 5th c. dating. You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, \"\"la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies\"\" or in English \"\"the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades\"\"). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't \"\"remain\"\" disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing \"\"revived\"\" the critical points in 1961.\n",
      " Where you perhaps have a point (with \"\"remains\"\") is that Toumanoff's main point, the \"\"Bagratids argument\"\", had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).\n",
      " I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (\"\"revived... continue to maintain\"\"). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.\n",
      "  \n",
      "Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   \n",

      "Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says: \n",

      "Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true. master \"\n",

The argument which Mr Johnson deployed at the hearing last week was to the following effect: An Italian avvocato is not a solicitor or a barrister; therefore he is not one of those persons entitled under Rule 38 of the Prison Rules 1999 to make a legal visit to Mr Van Hoogstraten in Belmarsh Prison. There was before the court last week evidence that Mr Di Stefano is an Italian avvocato. There are a number of references to this in the documentation before me. Perhaps most pertinently the bundle at page 67 includes Mr Di Stefano's identification card and halfway down we see: \"\"Professione Avvocato\"\". On the right of that there is a photograph of Mr Di Stefano and his signature.\n",

      "\n",
      "17. It should be borne in mind that Mr Di Stefano is the lawyer who has been chosen by the claimant to represent him in criminal proceedings. He has been chosen as the lead lawyer to represent the claimant, and under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the claimant is entitled to be represented by the lawyer of his choice. That must entail the opportunity to confer with the lawyer of his choice before he appears for sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "25. Mr Di Stefano has been appointed as the principal legal adviser of the claimant. It seems to me that Mr Di Stefano has exercised wise judgment in the legal team which he has appointed. He has selected as one of the Leading Counsel to make the plea in mitigation a leading authority in the field of criminal sentencing. Mr Tam submits that with such a distinguished legal team it is quite unnecessary for Mr Di Stefano to visit his client in prison. He can receive instructions at secondhand, and Article 6 does not require Mr Di Stefano's presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "26. I do not agree. Mr Van Hoogstraten has chosen Mr Di Stefano as his principal legal adviser. The choice of principal legal adviser is for the client. It is not for me; it is not for counsel in this case or anybody else. It is a matter for the client, and if he wishes to appoint an Italian avvocato as his principal legal adviser, and that Italian avvocato has rights to practise in this country under the 1978 Order, then Mr Van Hoogstraten is entitled to take that course. \n",

As for his competance, that was always open too.  Being a balls to the wall aggressive cavalryman doesn't make him a military genius but being so, winning, and surviving is close.  And in the end, close isn't always good enough.  After Gettysburg he encountered General Longstreet and tried to convince General Lee's stout lieutenant he had him outnumbered and out gunned.  He requested Longstreet's surrender in person.  Longstreet ordered his staff to bring several Confederate divisions up to attack including General Pickett's.

First, it doesn't contain any actual way to determine what disruption is, meaning that the definition is left to be decided elsewhere (like on the Ref Desk Policy Page).

They certainly were no more severe than \"\"small-scale vandalism\"\": \"\"For instance, one user gratuitously insulting another user, while inappropriate, is not disruptive.  Neither is simple small-scale vandalism.\"\"  They then follow up with an example quite similar to what happened with your block of LC:  \"\"Furthermore, don't cause actual disruption in an effort to fix a perceived disruption. An excellent example of this is the Great Userbox War of 2006; several users who claimed userboxes were disruptive, set about deleting and trying to stop further creation of such userboxes. The ensuing fight was orders of magnitude more disruptive than any supposed disruption for which the userbox opponents were able to provide evidence. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it is disruption. Disruption is a large-scale hindrance of Wikipedia's ability to function, whether technically, administratively, or socially. An insult, or even a string of insults targeted at several users, does not do this.\"\"  They then finish up with: \"\"Please note, however, that 'disruption' is often Wiki-code for 'something admins don't agree with', which also seems to be exactly what is happening here.  \"\n",

Thirdly, some of the audience say they see \"\"dark beings\"\" and other such things on the webcams every week - not just in this programme. I think it really would be better to limit the Most haunted reference to the fact that it was the most watched programme on television that night, as the rest of it is unsubstantiated speculation that trivialises the subject.   \"\n",

These are the raw and unbiased facts (not speculation).

      "Hello, Max, this is indef-blocked User:Doughnuthead speaking. I firmly believe I can finally be of positive use to Wikipedia, and I no longer feel the need to gain attention through malicious editing. I'd actually all but forgotten about all the nonsense i had caused in the previous years until i saw a funny picture online of a guy with a swollen head, which reminded me of my username. But more to the point, i realised that my ability to edit the talk page was barred. After taking a look at previous edits, i realised i was being a bit of a tube. You were right to take that ability away. So just a heads up that i can only edit on anon as this account is obviously still suspended. In terms of getting unblocked, i haven't made a single edit to Wikipedia in almost 3 years, and during this time i have matured enough to the point that i look back at what i was getting up to and think 'Oh god! Who was i even trying to impress?!' In terms of where i aim to get involved in on the website, I still hold a strong interest in football (soccer) related articles, along with hip-hop and old school rock related articles- hence my music taste. As it has been so long since I bothered to use the editing facility, I'll need re-shown how to work various parts of the site or whatever it's called. I only remembered how to request unblock by clicking on the 'edit' tab and noticing one of my old templates! Furthermore, I don't intend to be an overly active user on the site, as I begin my university course in September much of my time will be dedicated towards my studies, and so I intend to see Wikipedia as a hobby to input my thoughts and research every now and then. Finally, thank you very much for reading my request - I appreciate the time taken to do so and I apologise for my past behaviour. I was just a stupid kid (it lasted from age 12-15 if I recall!) and I hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.\n",

That is why I have reproduced the exchange on my talk page as it has been deleted from where it originally occurred with only my YouTube post left intact. I wonder why he did that? My remark above contains nothing profane and represents my view of his outrageous behavior and was placed nowhere but on MY OWN TALK PAGE. And as far as personal attacks go, I consider his use of the term \"\"Gun Nut\"\" as well as mocking my family name to be such that went unpunished. Calling someone a \"\"Gun Nut\"\" is perfectly OK but referring to someone as \"\"Hysterically Paranoid\"\" is not???

Every Alawi person i no Woships the Imam Ali in the Shia way, and worship all of the Prophet Mohammads family, and the we worship both the Prophet Mohammad and the Imam Ali, and follow both their teaching, we do not just follow the Imam Ali teachings, we follow the Prophets as well. Alawi int he past 50 years have become closer to Shia, and do not celebrate Christmas. Or any other Christian Eids. I know from me and my family we celebrate all Shia Eids, and for Ramadan nearly every year we choose to fast. And yes our teachings are kept private (not secrete) —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)   \n",
      "Well, we should probably discuss this on the talk page on the Alawi article, but anyway, I believe the Alawite beliefs vary quite a bit, my family do for example celebrate Christmas and other Christian festivals, but they are Lebanese, so they may have retained more of the original Alawite beliefs than the ones in Syria, who try harder to be accepted as true Muslims, so that the validity of Bashar Assad's presidency isn't questioned.    \n",

      "The part about How we Worship the Imam Al, to Alawi we follow both Teachings of the Imam Ali and the Prophet Mohammad. None of them come first, in your case your kinda saying that Ali comes first before the prophet. Alawi only have the Quran and their own scriputres as Islamic text. And iv read from other websites that Aparantly Alawi worship the Imam ALi like a God, when we dont. When you are trying to Explain the Trinity thing, your as basicly saying that we belive Ali is God, in 3 forms, which complely contridicts the point of us being Muslim. That there is no one but Allah and there is only One god, and he has no sons etc. And we believe in Rencarnation as is. And your should say that when the boys study the Alawi text, you should say after 15/16 boys can choose to go deeper into the relgion and study more, or choose not to study more. i no from my grandfather he went deep into the relgion and spent his whole life studying it. Where as my dad stoped when he got married and had kids (so around 22). \n",
      "Well, I didn't write the article, and I'm not sure who added the trinity stuff, but if it isn't sourced, it probably shouldn't be there. As for beliefs, well, as I mentioned before, the Alawites in Syria have changed their beliefs to become more like mainstream Muslims, so many of the older traditions might not be practiced there. It's different in Lebanon though, where the Syrian government is unable to regulate the sects like in Syria.    \n",

Given that the rate of growth of FAs is AFAIK greater then one a day this isn't likely to change anytime soon. TFA is really somewhat seperate from the FA process, the only connection is that TFAs must be FAs of course. Being a TFA should be thought of as a bonus more then anything else and there's nothing intrinsicly different between an FA which has been TFA and one that hasn't; they're all FAs and if they not they should be put up for FAR.

I know most editors are pissed off enough at me already 2. Adding anything to someone else's writing always looks jumpy,... Any article of \"\"importance\"\" seems to have collected its \"\"defenders\"\" - but honestly having the Holocaust article (and many others) make the holocaust stand on Vrba's testimony that cremation was accomplished using fat Jewish women as the fuel is not very likely even if it is \"\"reliable\"\". Good luck\n",

      "The Hebrew name for Hebrew, \"\"Ivrit\"\", is derived from \"\"Ivrim\"\" (the Hebrew word for \"\"Israelites\"\") meaning simply \"\"the language of the Israelites\"\". Neither word means \"\"side\"\". However, both of these words are constructed from the root consonants ע (/ʕ/,), ב (/v/) and ר (/r/). This means that they may be etymologically related to words such as /ever/ (\"\"side\"\"), /ma'avar/ (\"\"passage\"\"), /avar/ (\"\"to pass\"\", v.i. or \"\"to go over\"\"), /he'evir/ (\"\"to pass\"\", v.t.) and others.
