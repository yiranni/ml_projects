Well that's driven me back to read the 1976 postscript - it's a good read - where the following apologia looks relevant  ' ...' it is true that in 1955 I allowed some hectoring political moralisms, as well as a few Stalinist pieties, to intrude upon the text. I had then a somewhat reverent notion of Marxism as a received orthodoxy... The book was published at the height of the Cold War. Intellectual McCarthyism was not confined to the US... The climate can be illustrated by the welcome afforded my book in the non-Socialist press. This welcome was mainly silence, broken by the review in TLS headed 'Morris & Marxism''  So, yes the _1955_ edition was coolly received, in EPT's opinion largely because of his unfashionable Marxist viewpoint.

      "\"   Davey2010   I just read WP:BATTLE and WP:AGF, and accordingly I find your message to Davey mentioning me in that context (while deliberately trying to hide it from me) as extremely upsetting. I have nothing personal against Davey (despite what he claims), I am certainly not trying to make him afraid or upset or otherwise miserable. If he tries to claim I am, I will vigorously defend myself against such lies. If anyone has been treated unfairly, it has been me by him - he reported me for being a VANDAL for crying out loud! I assume you know exactly how wrong that was (I sadly only properly realised that after the event). AGF says \"\"If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence.\"\" Well, I have quite a lot of clear evidence now that Davey's lack of care in the subject area of buses/bus transport can only really be explained by him having a motive that is harmful to Wikipedia (to degrade the overall quantity and quality of its content on the subject). How else can you explain the phenomena of someone who claims to be a bus enthusiast and know a lot about buses, not having any clue how or why a list of trolleybus routes would be encyclopedic? Entire books have been written on just that subject! This is just one example. I have many more. If he had never claimed to know a lot about this subject, then yes, I could have assumed that this was just a case of amateurish but entirely innocent intent. But not any more. He clearly has a very specific idea about what Wikipedia should and should not contain on this subject, and it is quite clearly not explicitly supported by any of the rules. So, he is pushing the envelope far beyond the limits, and in some cases there's only one word to describe the things he says - pure lies. I'm sorry he's upset by the fact that I have the subject knowledge to be able to spot when he's not being truthful about certain things he says on this subject, and I'm sorry that he's upset that when he says something here breaks some rule or other, I actually take the time to check if that's true or not. But do not for a second confuse that with someone who is genuinely upset by someone stalking them or questioning their motives for no good reason. I could even go so far to say these might even be crocodile tears, since he doesn't appear to have been this sensitive over other issues where people are disagreeing with him - indeed he seems quite capable of telling people in no uncertain terms what he thinks of them. This is no shrinking violet, that's for sure.   \"\n",

      "\"   The Gamergate Conspiracy   We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a \"\"controversy,\"\" as we do now, or as a \"\"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.  A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.  A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.  We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.  “Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.  But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    \"\n",

I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message.  I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.  If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: \"\"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.\"\"  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a \"\"redirect\"\" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type \"\"The Wild Center\"\" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.  From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: \"\"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!\"\"  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying \"\"(Redirected from The Wild Center)\"\" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the \"\"Random article\"\" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing \"\"The Wild Center\"\" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on \"\"The Wild Center\"\" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see \"\"The Wild Center\"\" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.  You also say \"\"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.\"\"  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname \"\"The Wild Center\"\" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (\"\"The Otter Stop\"\", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.  Does this satisfy any of your concerns?  I'm interested in your response.  /talk/ \"\n",

All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to \"\"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter.\"\" And \"\"hereafter\"\" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed.

When I watched my copy, I found out it was the 2nd edition & I thought it was the only edition ever made. So, 1 day when I went to his house, I saw the trailer of Sleeping Beauty, then it said the \"\"Special Previews\"\" bumper & thought to myself, \"\"Where's the Pinocchio trailer? Did they cut it out? Is this a 2nd version from 1993? My copy of BATB has that trailer.\"\" I never saw the end of the 1st edition, but once Marco on this website told me he owned it, he told me that the Pinocchio trailer was still on there, but it was at the end, with the \"\"& now, here are the 2 special previews from Walt Disney Home Video!\"\" bumper & the 101 Dalmatians trailer after that. Then, I figured out that's how they originally made it & that my copy was the 2nd edition from 1993, when Pinocchio came out. I saw on the Page of Fortunecity that it dtopped out in 1993, but I wasn't sure when in 1993. Then I found that my copy was from 1993, when Pinocchio came out, so I was sure it dropped out when Aladdin came out & was sent back to the Disney Vault. BTW, since you told me that you saw the 2nd edition of Beauty & the Beast & you have a column on your user page called \"\"Videos I've Seen\"\", you could list down you saw that tape. Also, you might be able to know this, but if both editions of those tapes, along with 101 Dalmatians & The Great Mouse Detective have an Aladdin trailer, why doesn't the 1992 VHS of The Rescuers have an Aladdin trailer?  21:22\"\n",

Approach the Humanities faculty at MU maybe or the head Prof at any uni that offers Indigneous Studies quals and ask can wik have some content so that what goes up isnt total nonsense.

You could try 'Archaeology in Oceania' via JSTOR I think, or delve through Cambridge Uni journals available via Oz databases, etc or  if you have access to MU, u then have acess to their library so they should maybe have some decent texts.

If you don't mind, I would like to ask a question so I can better understand this; I am new to this, still learning. The background is that in the 1800s, the European settlement of the Sydney area was in its early days.  Place names were informal, and often duplicated.  There were at least two, probably three places on Sydney Harbour known as \"\"Ballast Point\"\" then.  This is what I attempted to clarify with my comment that it was another site also known by that name.

Also there would not be mob revenges and criminal activity out of government control. To clarify, even 3 years after war the government and country organization was very limited.

First I'd recommend you use the Sandbox to test out how your edits will look, as adding images to Wikipedia isn't always the most intuitive thing you can do.  Also, I don't think it's recommended to link to images external to Wikipedia.  If you are trying to upload an image you own, or that you can verify is free of copyright, use the Upload file function, then link to the image once it's on the wiki servers.  Hope that helps.

First, you shouldn't write articles about yourself, or your organization. Second, usernames must correspond to individuals (for legal license reasons), so having a username for your group would be against our policies.. After you look over that policy, could we discuss that concern here?

There are several options available to you:  We can talk about it, here.   You can abandon the contributions made under this name and create a new account that meets our username policy and addresses the concern(s) noted above.  Or, if you want to keep your contributions history under a new name, then you should visit Wikipedia:Changing username and follow the instructions there.

User  claims I have been changing the spelling of the name here despite his/her addition of references. A quick look will show I have been removing the references for matters outlined above but have not in any way changed the spelling of the name here.   The reference to Payne's involvement in The Stands (5) has been changed from a full length interview with Payne about The Stands in a national publication  (Designer Magazine) to review of a solo concert written 3 years after Payne's discontinuation of the group for a local fanzine that briefly introduces Payne as a former member of The Stands before reviewing a solo performance.   Payne emigrating to US at age 13 - no reference   Edgar Jones's commitment to Paul Weller being the reason for the break up of The Big Kids - No reference - Also Jones was no longer playing with Paul Weller at the time of The Big Kids break up (Winter 2001)    The information regarding Pilgrim and Thomson's departure and the subsequent demise of the group as a result of this is wholly misleading - Pilgrim left The Stands in December - 2004 and was replaced by Graham Robinson in January 2005. The Stands then releaesed the single Do It Like You Like  which entered the UK to 40 at no 26 and was used on the worldwide Revelon London Look  campagihn featuring Kate Moss. The Stands then toured with Oasis during both their Europian tour. Luke Thompson left The Stands in June 2005 and was replaced by Paul Molloy.  The Stands released Horse Fabulous in July 2005 played Glastonbury - V Festival - T in the Park - an Oasis UK stadium tour - and a headline tour before Howie Payne released a statement to say he was discontinuing The Stands in Nov 2005. All of this plus the fact that the bands label, Echo records was dissolved by Chrysalis during August 2005 is available on The Stands dedicated wiki page. To sum this up as user  has done is totally miss-leading and not based in fact. Regarding Payne's solo career the new piece mentions Payne spending time in Texas and Los Angeles with neither relevance or reference.  There is a further edit regarding Payne's name spelling and the submission implies there is a miss-spelling or changed spelling. As the only documents that are can decicivly prove the spelling of a persons birth name are Birth Certificate and Passport and none are provided here I will reserve judgement on this but I do think describing the spelling of Elliot (as here) as standard is ridiculous. There are at least popular spellings of the ame Elliott/Elliot/Eliot/Eliott/Elyott and it would seem the most popular is Elliott. I do not wish to appear to be pedantic regarding this but as this is typical of the caviler way user  has applied vague guesswork and then claimed them facts to the page in question and has accused me of changing his/her referenced submissions which is clearly not the case   I hope that as a long standing contributor to wikipeidia you can see that my aim is to prevent this page being a false interpretations of events littered with unnecessary unreferenced/POV information.  The previous page edition 01:30, 25 November 2012 has correct referenced information and I believe is a suitable and proper representation of events as per the information available at this point.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n",

      "\"   Morphology   I think that a few words should be written about endings of various kinds, and of distinctions of cases.  There seems to be some misunderstandings here and there in the project, with claims that \"\"German has preserved the proto-germanic grammar\"\" or similarly.  This is not 100% true (although German certainly has preserved much of the grammar).  I therefore think that mentioning the instrumental case, and the fact that there were more different endings in OHG than in modern High German is interesting enough to merit a section.  I do not think we should try to reproduce all paradigms; but some representative sample.  (However, I just know them from rather old books; and these books do not very carefully distinguish different epochs or dialects within the OHG.) I had in mind an example like this:      Sing.    Pl. N    tag    taga G    tages    tago D    tage    tagum A    tag    taga I    tagu    (not distinguishable)  and a few words on how e.g. 1:st and 3:rd p. pl. of the verbs then were quite distinct (in pres. ind. normally ending in -mes and -nt, and in pret. -m and -n, respectively); where in the modern language a final -m is replaced by an -n, making the forms indistinguishable.

      "\"== Cohanim J2 - Eleazar - Phinchas - Zadok ==   Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki have the final word about Cohanim genetic signatures. He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that \"\"he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2\"\". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. \"\"Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2\"\" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. \"\"Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2\"\" he suggested.  The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, \"\"effective\"\" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.  Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?  “Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood. He is given the Divine Covenant of Peace and the gift of eternal priesthood. Zadok, a des\n",

      "\"  British Army  Hi Buckshot06  About the British Army: This morning I got back to work and after some hours I finished the 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division, only to than find out, that everything will change again! (see here)  This is maddening! Isn’t there an official document about the reorganisation? When I made the graphics of the Australian and German Army, I based them on the future organization of these Armies (“Hardened and Networked Army” & \"\"Heer 2010\"\") and if I could find a document, which will show, how the British Army will be structured after the “Army Plot” has been abolished, then I would do another attempt to finish the Graphic.  About the Russian Ground Forces- let’s do this -) If you have the information, I will do the graphic. What I need to know before I can begin the work is which units compromise which Brigades/ Divisions, where they are base, what kind of units they are… and so on. Strike-through text I.e: i had a look at the Moscow Military District and the infos that are missing are: 2nd Tamanskaya Div: Are the regiments multi- or single battalion units? Is the 147th Guards Artillery Rgt. a self proplled unit? 34th Guards Artillery Div: Which are its units?  27th Sevastopolskaya Guards Motor Rifle Brig. Which are its units?  20th Army: Are there any units directly under the Army Command? 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division: Perfect- with info like this my work becomes pure fun -) 10th Guards Uralsko-Lvovskaya Tank Div: Where are its units based? 22nd Army: same question as with the 20th Army 3rd Vislenskaya Motor Rifle Div: Which are its units?  Operational Group of Russian Forces in Moldova (Tiraspol)(formerly Fourteenth Army)  8th Motor Rifle Brigade Which are its units?  16th Spetsnaz Brigade: Which are its units?  A division-sized weapons and equipment storage base at Yelnya, the former 144 Guards MRD: A Divison sized *unit? In regards to the amount of men under command or the equipment stored?  16th Air Army other formations and units: Which?  As you see there is a lot of work involved in getting all the information together.

      "\"   Discussion moved from Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Doctor Who   I know you're all probably sick to your back teeth of hearing about it, but considering how we have just changed the name of the 1996 television film to Doctor Who (1996) (in my personal opinion, an infinitely better name), why not try to resolve the seemingly never ending debate of whether it is 100,000 BC or An Unearthly Child? Talk:100,000 BC (Doctor Who)  19:02, 9th January 2006 (GMT)  Okay can we also try to bring peace to the Middle East and Northern Ireland, bring harmony between all religions, sort out whether the UK is an international or European country and all those other things that have been fiercely argued a lot? ;-)    I hate to say it, but I think the debate is about to get a second wind, seeing as the upcoming American DVD release, The Beginning dubs the story An Unearthly Child and also uses the Edge of Destruction name for the Inside the Spaceship two-parter...    I think you're right, and that we should think about people less familiar with the original series; after all, a lot of people who have only watches the Ninth and Tenth Doctors in action will snap up the boxset, to learn more about Doctor Who. Calling it An Unearthly Child will not only help these \"\"newbies\"\", but also seeth the feelings of quite a lot of Whovians I know. (As well as this, at least half of the sources I have seen - official or otherwise - call it \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\").  20:39, 9 January 2006  The current opener to the article and the redirects handle the requirements anyway. Fandom has long been deeply divided and I don't think some notion of appeasing one wing of the debate should direct where the Wikipedia page is located.     I agree. As long as the proper redirects are in place and the article acknowledges the alternate titles, I think we're good. This isn't quite the same situation we had with the TV movie when an off-the-cuff remark by the producer calling it Enemy Within came to be seen as somehow official. (And the Doctor Who Information Network here in Canada apparently uses a different title altogether that was mentioned in a CBC profile of the series made to tie in with the Eccleston season. I forget the name that was used.).    The CBC profile I think used \"\"Out of the Ashes\"\", which apparently came from a misreading of Shannon Patrick Sullivan's webpage.  As for 100,000 BC vs. An Unearthly Child, I agree that the redirects and article opening make the issue less pressing, but I also think that the title used in the DVD release (which isn't just in the US, but UK as well) lends a bit more weight to the An Unearthly Child argument.  However, if we do reconsider the page's location, I agree that it shouldn't be about appeasing one group or another, but what's best for the article.  — (talk • contribs)   The DVD releases seal it for me - these should both be at their DVD titles, with the others being redirects.    That's a good point to raise. I personally believe that it should be An Unearthly Child; but then it's not up to me, and I fully understand where Josiah is coming from. Why don't we settle this once and for all: a democratic vote where Whovians like ourselves vote for one title or the other. Anyone else agree/have another idea?   16:18, 11 January 2006  I'll put my vote in as An Unearthly Child also.    It's been said before, but I'll say it again. The title of the serial is 100,000 BC. The title of the first episode is \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\". The fact that BBC Enterprises releases the DVD as \"\"An Unearthly Child\"\" is a matter of marketing, not historicity, and neither here nor there. The real reason the serial was called An Unearthly Child to begin with was because of a mistake by the Radio Times. AUC redirects to the right page, and there's no confusion. I'd rather rename The Daleks to The Mutants rather than change 100,000 BC to that.  (talk • contribs) 16:39, 11 January 2006\n",

I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

      "A Short History of Republican Sinn Féin    In 1902, Arthur Griffith, Editor of the United Irishman, presented to the third annual convention of Cumann na nGaedheal the most revolutionary political idea since the fall of Parnell; it was that the elected Irish Members of Parliament should refuse to sit in Westminster, demand reinstitution of the Irish Parliament of 1782, and pledge allegiance only to a king of Ireland, not to the King of England. While the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell, had once considered such unilateral action, he had not forced the issue. Griffith provided a strategy of passive resistance by turning an assembly of Irish MPs into a de facto constitutional convention. Modeled on Frank Deak’s policy, which resulted in the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary in 1867, Griffith serialized his abstentionist program in the United Irishman as the Resurrection of Hungary, and then published it as a pamphlet and distributed it widely in 1904. The direct result of this idea was the formation of Sinn Féin on 28th November 1905, as an abstentionist political party, with internal self-reliance as its principal plank, pledging never to recognize or use the services or forces of the enemy. The founders of Sinn Féin were Arthur Griffith, Seán T. O’Kelly, Bulmer Hobson, Countess Markiewicz and Seán Mac Diarmada. In addition to contesting a Parliamentary election in North Lietrim in 1908, Sinn Féin was also active locally, electing a number of men to county councils and other local bodies.   Historian, lecturer, Conradh na Gaeilge president and Radio Free Éireann (public service broadcasting, 99.5 FM in New York) commentator Nollaig Ó Gadhra points out that the big change in Sinn Féin came in the Árd Fheis of 1917, when the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) under the guidance of Michael Collins and the Irish Volunteers under Cathal Brugha, caused Sinn Féin to change its policy from monarchist to republican abstention. After the Rising, Sinn Féin adopted an election manifesto for all elections, insisting upon the Irish Republic Proclaimed on Easter Monday, 1916. Éamonn deValera, campaigning in an Irish Volunteer uniform, was elected for East Clare in June 1917. At the Árd Fheis of Sinn Féin in October 1917, Arthur Griffith graciously stepped down from President to Vice President of Sinn Féin, to allow the election of deValera, who, after the death on hunger strike of Thomas Ashe, was the senior surviving Commandant from 1916.   This was the Sinn Féin which contested the general election of 14 December 1918, promising to NOT represent their constituents or their country in the mighty Westminster Parliament in London, but rather to set up, without foreign let or hindrance, a Republican assembly which would form an Irish government for Ireland. Sinn Féin won over 79% of the popular vote in all Ireland, and 73 of 105 seats, in what can only be described as a plebiscite for independence. The delegates who assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin formed the First Dáil Éireann and issued the Irish Declaration of Independence on 21 January 1919 (legally the equivalent of the American Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, promulgated on the 4th of July 1776). That Easter Monday, 1916 is regarded as the significant date is a consequence of the pre-existing Army Council of the Irish Republican Army – Óglaigh na hÉireann (the IRA) insisting upon the First Dáil Éireann recognizing the Irish Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916, as a condition for the IRA coming under the authority of the government formed by the First Dáil Éireann. [See also Dorothy Macardle, The Irish Republic (New York, 1965).]   The democratic voice of the Irish people had spoken (vox populi, vox Dei), and their elected representatives sought the recognition of their national self-determination as promised by American President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, on which basis the Armistice ending the Great War on 11 November 1918, had been accepted by the Central Powers. Ireland was denied recognition and a seat at the Versailles peace conference. The ensuing conflict between the forces of the Imperial Government in London and the Irish Republic has become known to history as the “Black and Tan War” (1919-1921). But, the military lessons of Dublin 1916 having been studied in the internment camp of Frongoch, the forces of the Irish Republic waged an asymmetrical conflict against the alien forces of occupation. Modern guerilla warfare entered on to the twentieth century. England, though still in control of many strong points, could no longer coerce Ireland into remaining peacefully within her empire. A Second (Republican) Dáil Éireann came together in August 1921 (124 Sinn Féin and 4 Unionist members). Nollaig Ó Gadhra, in Civil War in Connacht (Cork & Dublin: Mercier Press, 1999), points out that the Sinn Féin delegates regarded their mandate to be as Teachta Dála Éir\n",

My intention is simply to tell the truth.  Even if it hurts.  On that, I don't compromise.  If that appears suidical to you, it's a sad indictment on the frequency of truth telling in you neck of the woods.  Others compromise on truth, often because they care about $$$ more than truth.  That's what I believe motivates the deletions on WP and elsewhere regarding monetary reform.  That's why this stuff isn't EVER published in \"\"mainstream\"\" sources.  This stuff is starved of funds until it dies.  People who care about $$$ more than truth hate people pointing this out to them.  Because it hurts.  It shows they aren't very smart, but they are very selfish.  It's as simple as that.  One other thing.  Wealth distribution is a separate and distinct issue from the issue of money creation and distribution.  They are related and they do interact, but they are distinct issues.  Many Libertarians (such as Ron Paul) couldn't care less about wealth distribution provided the way in which money creation is just and in accordance with the U.S. Constitution.  Free markets can determine wealth distribution - provided the way in which money is created is open and democractically approved and \"\"just\"\" and the product of rational discussion (i.e. not based on the threat of a bullet to the head if you question the current method of money creation and distribution).  Once new money is created, it gets gets circulated according to the tax laws, and competition laws, and finance laws and a multitude of other factors, and ends up in someone's account somewhere.  Money creation is (arguably) much more important and has many more dynamic implications for an economy than wealth distribution, which is a separate issue.  Again, this confusion shows that the level of understanding of these issues is woeful and I despair at ever increasing the general public's understanding of these vitally important issues, especially given the limitless $$$s financing the countervailing forces (Gregalton, Zenwhat, etc) that are lined up against anyone questioning the sustainability and pointing out the absolute stupidity of the current debt-based system.  \"\n",

But obviously  rest of the world is a bigger domain than America - so the general consensus should be what most people in the world feel .  Secondly people do refer to football as soccer in UK - no one is denying that .But if people say that they are going to watch a football match , it obviously means a soccer match - not a rugby match .  Just because a very small minority in the world feels football refers to some other sport- why should we insult the beautiful game by not devoting the page on football to football as the world knows it?  Majority of the world refers to Osama Bin Laden as a terrorist .But there are still many people in the world who refers to Osama as a freedom fighter .So does that mean we say Osama Bin Laden is a freedom fighter? No.  When you have 6 billion people in the world and more than 5 billion refer to football as the FIFA version which is a very very large majority (the fact that FIFa has more members than the UN and the fact that FIFA has the word football in it should justify that fact) , then shouldnt the general consensus swerve towards the majority .

Peter III of Aragon   What is your rationale for preferring the late portrait of Peter over a contemporary coin? Your edits are predominantly changes to lead images, yet you almost never leave an edit summary explaining them. You also reverted my change without even knowing what \"\"contemporary\"\" means or whether a certain image was contemporary with the subject or not. The reasons to prefer the coin are: it is a contemporary artefact, giving information about Peter's reign (w/ a caption) and about how he was seen by his subjects in his lifetime the coin does not mislead readers about the times of Peter III, as the portrait might the silver coin on a white background is more striking than the somewhat garish portrait in low-resolution JPG format it is far more likely that the limited detail of the coin is accurate (clean shaven and long-haired) than the greater detail of the imaginary portrait the later portrait is one of a series of nearly indistinguishable royal portraits from two centuries later, it gives us no information about Peter or his reign, its sole purpose was decorative what makes the coin an image of Peter is that that is when it was struck and what for, but what makes the later portrait an image of Peter is that somebody labelled it that way—they could just as easily have labelled an image of any other Aragonese king  In your last edit summary, you ask \"\"if I have to choose between two unreal representations, I prefer the portrait\"\", but nobody is asking you to choose or what you prefer.     Srnec, the problem is that we have different criteria.  You think the images should provide information about the lives of the persons and be of the age in which these people lived. I think the only thing to do is to give a visual representation of the person, the article is to the information.  I think that a portrait (even if wasn't painted during the live of the person) is most valid that a little image carved in a coin. The two representations have the same chance of not being 100% accurate, but at least one illustrates better than the other.  If not exist any portrait of this person, then I accept a coin's image or a poor drawing. But the present picture accomplish the role and I think that it must be more time.    I already argued why the coin is a better illustration and you've just asserted the contrary. Do you have an argument? Why are your criteria better than mine?     Really? When I rebutted all your arguments in your talk page, I stated my reasons. But I do not want another long discussion with you. I offer consensus. Would you take a picture of the first part of the thirteenth century?   Both of those are improvements over the 17th-century image, but not over the coin. At least one other editor agrees with me.    Sorry I'm not agree with your second comment, but I hope we have made ​​a step in the right direction. This discussion is already too long. Both images are the best ones that meet your rigid standard of closeness to the character's life. Either both seem right.     Imposing your personal preference is not how it occurs on Wikipedia   I noticed in the message above that this is not the first time that you try to impose pictures on articles regardless of what others think. You are not allowed to impose your will. Both Pedro I of Brazil and Pedro II of Brazil are Featured Articles. They were reviewed by several editors. Stop with your edit warring.     Lecen is aware of the three-revert rule. Are you? You've reverted four times on both Pedro I and Pedro II in the last 24 hours.

      "\"  GA review process  Well, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to \"\"get the ball rolling\"\" – naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (\"\"This review looks very much like a \"\"favour\"\" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator\"\") is very regrettable – perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here – also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations.  From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically: MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsis Restructuring of criticism section and dealing with \"\"stubby paragraphs\"\" Consistency in spelling  Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism \"\"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form\"\" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject)  Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body  Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone  Needs more images  That should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area. Anyway it is a terrific learning experience. Thanks to all who shared their opinions.   \"\n",

      "This is the lead as it currently reads: Lance Edward Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson, September 18, 1971) is an American former professional road racing cyclist and triathlete. He won the Tour de France seven consecutive times (1999-2005) but was stripped of those titles by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) and banned from cycling in 2012.  We have basically two things to consider: whether this is factually correct and whether it provides the proper emphasis. I'd say that the first clause of the second sentence is at the very least misleading since 1) there is now a consensus in the world at large that Armstrong did not properly win the Tour de France ever and since 2), as far as official racing he is concerned, he did not win the Tour de France at all. It would be far more accurate to say that Armstrong was once considered to have won the Tour de France seven times. This state of affairs is very unlikely to change. As for emphasis, at this point Armstrong is more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else. As time passes this is bound to  intensify. Since it is now obvious that Armstrong achieved his original fame by cheating and committing fraud, there is no reason he should not be more known as a cheater and a fraud than as anything else.\n",

I would reconsider your archiving system and move all of the old comments out onto this main page.  Archive every few months or set number of comments, like every 25 or 50 comments. Thanks. —  talk    I do my archiving in this manner because I simply detest going to a talkpage and going through mountains of comments.  It is a waste of time.  I may need to have more comments on each archive page and can willing do that.  However, keeping talkpages tidy is a pet project of mine.     I would argue that this actually makes review talk pages more complicated, because you must open several different pages in order to see the progression of comments on a talk page.  If this is your desire though, please only do so in your user space and leave talk page archiving in the main space to convention of larger comment blocks.  Thanks. —  talk    I can go along with what you're saying.  Usually if I have a mountain of comments to read I most likely will not read them.  Going to another page just makes it easier for my mind to comprehend.  Of course I have medical reasons for this that the rest of you may not have to deal with.

My email is MythicWeb   He is one of our brothers and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.  The people on that article are members of SCOX, an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples.  These people have been posting a lot of negative content and POV pushing about him.  They acuse anyone of sockpuppetry who goes near the article.  Thanks for policing my user page.  Please feel free to revert it again  they are creating sockpuppets accounts and are warring with us over some discussion I posted to the Talk page. A very rowdy group.  They also accussed you of sockpuppetry and of being Merkey.     No one ever accused Bookofsecrets of being Merkey.  I pointed out his admission and apology for past sockpuppetry and suggested that he should teach you to abandon that behavior.  The Yahoo SCOX bulletin board discusses the SCO Group stock and related issues, including Merkey's aid to SCO's cause and his business connections to them.  Claiming that they are an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples is both  libelous untrue and silly.  —    My apologies for originally using a term which might imply a legal threat.

That's why parser-generators for LR(1) and related classes, are popular.  I think you might be confusing LR(1) with \"\"generalized LR\"\" or \"\"GLR\"\".  This algorithm can parse any context free grammar in worst-case O(n^3), but is vastly more powerful than either LR(1) or LL(1)  in fact, you can reduce any instance of binary matrix multiplication to an instance of context-free (and hence GLR) parsing, so we'll unlikely to ever find an algorithm that runs faster than the fastest matrix-multiplication algorithm.   \"\n",

Should the GMC find problems that are beyond repair then the school will be closed, and then no need to bash anymore because the school will fade away.

      "Bard Of Ely Hi there, I just noticed that the page for Bard Of Ely was removed from Wikipedia. [] I feel that there should have been some sort of tag attached to the page before removal. I also am mystified by the reference of the dismissal of the the page due to your comment,(promotion written by a friend). I have found that indeed Bard Of Ely is a noteable artist, and should have remained in the Wikipedia listings. For instance, did you know, Bard Of Ely has an EP out on a proper label(Crai Records), and he worked with musicians such as Crum(ex-Hawkwind[], Phil Moxham (Young Marble Giants), Robin Williamson(Incredible String Band) and Gruff Rhys (Super Furry Animals)and having compered and played at Glastonbury Festival [] and the Green Man Festival [] as well as having been rave reviewed in the NME []. I suppose it's up to the wandering editors to make these decisions. But, how do you determine a friend wrote the info on Bards page ??? For instance, I do not know Bard Of Ely personally, and could be considered a professional associate of Bard. Does this mean I can write a page about Bard Of Ely and it won't be removed ???? Please clarify the standards by which you elected to remove Bards page other than it may have been written by a friend. ie; For instance, the content was not verified and credible. Also, please indicate what makes an article not to the standard of Wikipedia, when in fact the references made in the article are internal links that have a direct relavence to the encyclopedia itself. I'm not trying to cause a stir here, but, I find it strange that Bards page was ripped down, when in fact I have found a few other artists pages that have been left up, and do not contain the same concrete documentation as Bard Of Ely's did. If you would like me to point those out to you, all you have to do is ask !!!! Take care, and please understand, that I am trying to understand some of the standards you work under for deciding to remove pages of Wikipedia noteable musical artists. Thank you, be well, and please accept my questions with all seriousness.  Cheers,\n",

      "\"   Pessimism v. optimism in Beckett.   I have an issue with the statment \"\"Beckett's work is . . . deeply pessimistic about the human condition\"\" as found in the first paragraph. I changed \"\"deeply\"\" to \"\"deceptively,\"\" and it was immediately changed back. I don't know how to contact the subsequent editor directly, so I'll post this here by way of discussion.  Perhaps replacing “deeply” with “deceptively” is not the best fix, but as it stands the quoted statement puts forth, as fact, an opinion that is widley open to interpretation.  Beckett’s writings aren’t just about the journey. If they were, “deeply pessimistic” would be nearly undebatable. They’re just as much about the destination, or at least the goal. And while he frames life’s journey as a slog through shit, his ultimate implication is that the slog is worthwhile. As everything from the Greek and Latin classics to the greatest of Hollywood’s pro-war propaganda movies have proven again and again, the more monstrously you portray the obstacle, the larger looms the hero who overcomes them. The same is true in Beckett: the obstacles are unrelenting and nearly insurmountable, but the journey continues, heroically. The Beckett hero may be standing in the dark, but he's faced towards the light, distant—an unattainable—as it may be.  The essential Beckett quote isn’t “I can’t go on”—full stop; it’s “I can’t go on. I’ll go on.”  Now, I may not have convinced you, personally, that Beckett’s work is more optimistic than pessimistic. But perhaps I’ve made a case that a flatly factual statement like “Beckett's work is stark . . . and deeply pessimistic about the human condition” is a bit overstated for an article that strives to remain free of bias.   Beckett himself would be the first to disagree with you. He once said that if he were a pessimist, he wouldn’t write.  Although I know that the artist is not always the most reliable source for understanding his work, that ought to count for something.\"\n",

      "\"   Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the city   Dear Salvio,  You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.  May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2  and Chesdovi) are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.  There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag, that is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.  It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND  at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on \"\"North Nicosia\"\" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.  This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the   Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.  In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an \"\"encyclopedic\"\" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.    \"\n",

Luther believed original sin, the inborn curse that makes everyone a sinner from conception, separated us all from God forever. In Luther's view, the law is designed to show us our sin and lost state, condemn us to hell for our disobedience and drive us to Christ for salvation. The Gospel comforts sinners with the good news that Christ died on the cross in our place so that our guilt is atoned for, our sins forgiven and a new life planted within us. From Luther's perspective, it is important to jusfication because it details the way that God gives us His grace.

You can discover why by checking the archives at Wikipedia:Requests for permissions/Denied/January 2009#Mikaey.     Joseph Stalin My text wasn't edited, it was reversed.  I was trying to improve the article by removing POV and making neater summaries.   Look further back at my edit history and you'll see my edits were heavy rewrites to flimsy sections, not reverts done to annoy people.  Also, nobody else has really done anything substantial for this article for quite some time.  In the months I've been working on it, other writers have only been adding snippets or links.   So... if I added extensive justifications to my edits, they might pass?  People complain that this article is biased, and I'm trying to FIX that.  Also, I replaced the lead image of Stalin with a photograph, but Tocino thinks the previous painting is better.  A painting, especially a flattering one made for propaganda, is inferior to an actual photograph, especially on as sharp as the one I've put in (you can even see his pockmarks).    Hello I have made sure that I have not violated the 3RR rule because I have been suspended for this in the past. I have waited patiently for a day to pass before I could add the better, more famous image of Stalin (which was on the article before Kurzon came along). Unfortunately, Kurzon has taken a different tactic and in the past couple of hours he has reverted three times without an edit summary to two different editors.     Late Bloomer   I came across the AfD on Late bloomer, which seems interesting & worth keeping, but had no references. They are not really needed, since it is a summary-type article with links to fully-referenced articles on the people mentioned, but I started doing the mechanical job of adding references. Then I saw your note that the article seems to have degraded from earlier versions. In what way? Don't want to continue adding refs if an earlier version would be a better starting point...      Query about an \"\"official page\"\"   Hi Mikaey,  Yesterday I attempted to post a page on here on behalf of an organisation for which I am currently working as an intern (FDC). Only problem was that we have a specific and official way of saying things which happens to be that of the website and several primary, so I just referenced there. In your review you stated \"\"We cannot accept copyrighted content taken from web sites or printed sources.\"\" There are several similar non-profit organisations which have pages on Wikipedia with their official statements published too, I was just wondering if copyright still applies when you are the authorised party? Is there any way I can have this article published without changing the words away from our official statement? Also if I just change the words briefly so it is different from the website but still conveys the message of our organisational profile can it then be published?  Any help would be much appreciated as I am pretty stuck with where to go on this. Thank you so much in advance     The user here is talking about this page from the AfC queue.  I declined it because at least one section (About the FDC) seemed to be a word-for-word copy from their website.  Notwithstanding any other issues with this article, would someone like to weigh in on the issue of the text's copyright status?  If the organization agrees to let the text be published under the GFDL, would he be good?  Thanks,    If the organization releases the text as GFDL through an OTRS email, there should be no problem with the \"\"copyrights\"\"; but the article as a whole has too much WP:COI and how they wrote their phone numbers and email addresses looks spamy. The article dosen't say anything about notability of the company either. Oh you were asking only about copyrights..sorry. An OTRS email would be sufficient.

Obviously not in nomenclature. Is it the case that the artists do use Munsell's colors in their work, but change the names (e.g. Munsell's purple → artist's violet, and Munsell's red-purple → artist's purple)?

The latter interpretation seems more logical, but if that is the case, why does this introductory sentence on terpenes complicate itself by introducing seemingly unnecessary information on organic molecules? \"\"However, the biochemical pathways for the synthesis of similar or even identical compounds often differ markedly between fungi and plants, which is shown by studies that have demonstrated that the fungal and plant enzymes for making these compounds differ strongly in their sequence and other characteristics, indicating that they have evolved separately in fungi and plants.\"\" This is a very long sentence.

I also note again that the erroneous claims and deceit on the part of the editor making the complaint once more go completely unaddressed.  If any editors are interested in how there is a leftist bias prevailing within politics pages at WP, and how this is upheld by Admin when a challenge is made from an editor interested in correcting this, I invite them to look at what has been going on recently at the Roger Scruton page, which now will go on reading like an article that would be written by a left-wing tabloid and not an encyclopedia entry. The pattern, for those who are interested, is as follows:   Leftist editor posts biased and inaccurate entries on WP politics page based on prejudice and ignorance, or in pursuit of an agenda to discredit a figure on the right of the political spectrum;  Posts challenged by another editor;  Leftist editor cannot cope with being challenged and having his ignorance/bias/agenda exposed;  Leftist editor creates trumped-up (and in the latest example regarding the 3RR violation, in fact completely bogus) charges against the editor that has \"\"wronged\"\" him and brings them to admin – a tactic that the \"\"wronged\"\" editor knows will result in the \"\"blocking\"\" (in effect censorship) of the editor who tried to address the leftist bias.  This is a process of censorship, and the procedure that is gone through at Admin nothing more than a show trial. It is rather ironic that I should see proof positive of this leftist bias at the Scruton page – Scruton has after all himself been vilified by the left throughout his career.   \"\n",

      "Hello Botteville. Yes, I suppose it is more or less a misunderstanding. The things are quite complicated and there is another possibility for the origin of the latinized version Carolus and I do not think it directly comes from *Kar(i)laz, because Carolus was borrowed from Germanic, when Common Germanic had already disappeared for a long time, that is quite hypothetic, and there is another possible etymology. See for example this very well documented site . I suppose Carolus was borrowed from Old High German or Old Franconian. That is why I do not accept the very shortened statement *Kar(i)laz > Carolus. I agree totally about Carolus > Charles, with some typical French phonetic shifts. I know that the meaning of churl is different, but it is the same etymological root, ultimatly from *kar(i)laz, sure, but through an intermediate West Germanic form *keril-.

When making player additions to the New Jersey Devils article, could you also add the player to the list of Devils players? Thanks! Masterhatch 5 August 2005 Is this a complete list that will be updated periodically? Do we have a master database for this information anywhere?  (T | C)   Devils Captain soon? Say RGTraynor and/or Masterhatch, do you know if the Devils plan to name Patrik Elias captain, when he returns to the lineup? Or is the captaincy to remain vacant for the 2005-06 season?   No knowledge, although possibly the Devils' website has an archived press release to that effect.  In any event it's speculative, and there's no need to post anything until and unless the Devils make any formal announcement of a new captain.      I've added Scott Niedermayer to the Devils \"\"Captain list\"\", as he's on the captains list, in the Offical New Jersey Devils website.   Because we really need more reminders of how we got shafted this season?? ;)  (T | C)   Wow, the is team most of the most amount of American players in the NHL!    Scouts and Rockies Why are you expanding content knowing that such content has articles to themselves???   Because I plan on expanding the Scouts & Rockies articles beyond what they say, and the history of the organizations should be mentioned in the article on the current version of the franchise.  I'm thinking ahead to when this is further expanded, since I plan on improving this article to Featured article status. Besides, they're still only paragraphs compared to the main article as a whole.   Hit me up...   Maybe others disagree, but I think this article should only explain the circumstances of the Rockies relocation to NJ. Its also borderline plagiarism of the source you cited. It is obvious you took thier copy and merely editted it to your liking.     Current practice on the NHL Team Pages is to write up the history of previous incarnations of the same franchises on their particular pages, and have a very brief summary at best on the current page.  Expanding the KC/Colorado pages makes perfect sense; duplicating the same text on the NJ page is redundant and liable to be reverted.     Relevant to this discussion:Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of the New Jersey Devils  Steve Gionta dont remove that.   Why?  It is fairly unimportant information.  It is quite common for relatives to be in the same sport.  See Notable families in the NHL for a number of examples of relatives that have actually made it to the NHL.  I will remove the information.     Agreed.  Until Steve does something notable, he doesn't belong in the article.    Team Logo Can we come to a consensus on whether or not the logo should be used in the season-by-season record table? I don't know if it is legitimate fair use as I'm not a lawyer. I would rather see the logos removed from that table because they are pointless and repetitive. In an article called \"\"New Jersey Devils\"\", can't we assume that someone looking at that table would know its referring to the New Jersey Devils? Is the fact that the logo once had green in it somehow relevant to their record on the ice?  (talk)  I can't comment on the fair use aspect, but I do agree that adding logos to each year in the records table is rather pointless.  \n",

      "\"   New review articles on human population genetics based on studies of ancient DNA   Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in human molecular genetics that helps trace the lineage of people living in various places on the earth. I've been reading university textbooks on human genetics \"\"for fun\"\" since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate  to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for improving articles on human genetic history and related articles. The  Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources.   The guidelines on reliable sources for medicine remind editors that \"\"it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge.\"\"   The guidelines, consistent with the  general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all \"\"Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources\"\" (emphasis in original). They helpfully define a primary source in medicine as one in which the authors directly participated in the research or documented their personal experiences. By contrast, a secondary source summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic. The general Wikipedia guidelines let us know that \"\"Articles should rely on secondary sources whenever possible. For example, a review article, monograph, or textbook is better than a primary research paper. When relying on primary sources, extreme caution is advised: Wikipedians should never interpret the content of primary sources for themselves.\"\"   Two review articles in prominent journals about human population genetics are bringing together analysis of the many recent studies of human DNA, including DNA from ancient individuals.   Earlier studies of this issue were based on more limited samples (fewer genes, and fewer human individuals from fewer regions and only recent times). As more samples of more genes from more individuals from more places and times are gathered, the molecular evidence is making it increasingly clear that human beings have been moving back and forth across the Earth's surface and mixing genes over long distances ever since their earliest ancestors moved out of the human homeland in Africa.

In other words - How does one differentiate what we know as atheism from religons that simply do not involve deities?  Perhaps in defining atheists we should use the term \"\"supernatural\"\" (e.g. Atheists reject the existense of dieties and the supernatural).  Would that be to broad a definition?

      "\"   Question on Possible Citation   I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page. In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view. (I haven't yet worked in \"\"no original research\"\".) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions. Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research. We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories. Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy. The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate.   Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source. The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer. I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct. However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable. The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made. The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources.   Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better. Attack articles are not encouraged. While we must show our subjects \"\"warts and all\"\" we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features. Balance is a part of NPOV. -   \"\"but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources.\"\" There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war. It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer. It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known. It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs. I don't see how that can be objective.    Bauer  I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al., but I've been somewhat overloaded at work. Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob. Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted . I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there. Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!     I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication. I've never done any such thing.   \"\"or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences\"\"  I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have. That isn't namecalling by a long stretch. I'm really weary of these attacks over this. This is mob rule. While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe. The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour. Blaming me won't make my points any less valid. Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd. It's the Internet equivalent of stoning.

There are, however, some obvious problems with the article's current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like \"\"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play\"\" or leading statements like \"\"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon\"\". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether \"\"W. dorsei\"\" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like \"\"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]\"\", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the \"\"genus currently contains five [...] species\"\", but only four are listed. I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information, rather than a blank contradiction. External links are meant to be a service to the reader, which that link isn't at the moment (no. 2 in WP:ELNO).   \"\n",

      "\"   Let me add a comment here in this discussion.  While it certainly seems strange that jokes are included on a page concerning 'religion', dismissing it completely without some discussion and consideration would be doing a disservice.  It may very well be that Bektashi culture is intimately tied to a rich collection of jokes which serve some pedagogical role in the religion.  For example, if we look at this site:   It is written that  \"\"X. Alevi-Bektashi Humor Alevis and Bektashis love to use humor to mock religious legalism, hypocrisy, and those who they feel have persecuted them. This humor reveals much about Alevi-Bektashi thought. To understand their humor is to understand the Alevi-Bektashis’ approach to life, religion, and their place in society. Here are only a few examples of the hundreds of Bektashi jokes (fıkralar) that have been collected. This first joke reflects the Alevi attitude toward the legalism of the five pillars\"\"   The author is John Shindeldecker, and he is listed as one of the researchers on the fairly official-looking homepage    In this case, this material suggests that humor is an integral part of defining Bektashi culture as distinctive from other factions of Islam.  Much as Zen Buddhism is characterized by the sometimes meaningless Koans or Gospel music in certain factions of Protestant Christianity.  In all of these cases, I don't think it's fair to say that it's like \"\"adding black jokes to an article about African Americans.\"\"  This comparison is also a bit overreaching, and unwarranted.  AldirmaGonul has made a good faith case for why the jokes should be placed on this page.  freestylefrappe has deleted it by only saying that it's \"\"suspect\"\" and \"\"racist\"\".  But given what we read from another source, this seems an overly simplified and inaccurate depiction of the \"\"jokes\"\" section.  I would like to hear an argument against these lines of evidence from freestylefrappe. \"\n",

      "\"  Advice To save me writing too much, a lot of this is going to be links to existing policies and guidelines - there is plenty of advice available, in fact a confusing amount, so pointers may be helpful. The guide to writing Your First Article and the Business' FAQ are particularly useful.  Wikipedia frowns on writing about your own organisation because of worries that someone with a conflict of interest will not be able to write from the Neutral Point of View which is one of our three key content policies. (The others are Verifiability and No Original Research). However, the anonymity of account names means it can't be prohibited, and it may be better to have a declared interest than somone pushing a case anonymously.  It should be possible for you to write an article about your organisation that won't get deleted, if you are careful. The first essential is to avoid any hint of promotion - be drily factual, as though you were unconnected with the organisation and had no interest in it, but were documenting it for completeness. See the guideline on peacock terms.  The next point is likely to be the problem if your organisation is new - notability, which is the Wikipedia term for \"\"of enough general interest for an encyclopedia article\"\". See the guidelines on Notability and Notability (organisations and companies). What you have to do is find references from reliable sources which are independent of you. Your own web-site etc are not considered independent. Has there been comment on your organisation, e.g. in the trade press? It may be that you will have to wait until you are more established and can cite independent references.  I wrote the above off-line: now that I come to post it, I see you have run into another problem - copyright. That's more of a problem than you might think, because everything in WP must released under the \"\"GFDL\"\" which says that anyone may do anything with it including rework it for commercial use - so just saying \"\"I agree to this being put in\"\" is not enough. The notice above tells you what you can do, but for the reasons in my third para above it is very likely that your mission statement will not be in suitable terms for Wikipedia, so the solution to the copyright problem may well be to rewrite it. That leads me to a last warning: an important difference between Wikipedia and a business directory is that you will not own your article - see WP:OWN - other people can and will edit it. See the warning at the bottom of the page you use to edit: \"\"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed for profit by others, do not submit it.\"\"  Regards,   \"\n",

I have also added the as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

      "\"  (deindent) Sorry for kibitzing, but I wanted to be fair to all points of view, even those of the dualists. so I tried to stick to presenting the thought experiments without drawing conclusions.  The thought experiment is this:   you have one observer  The observer gets cloned into copy 1 and copy 2 (either Hubert/Yorick or star-trek style)  The copies diverge, either because of internal noise, or because of the environment  From a third person point of view, this is an objective description of the evolution of a physical system, there is absolutely no ambiguity about what is going on- one observer becomes two. If probed, each copy would say that they were the initial observer before the cloning event. But viewed from the inside, if you are the observer getting cloned, there is a very natural question you can ask: Am I going to end up being copy 1 or am I going to be copy 2? This question cannot even be formulated from the outside, so it has no objective answer, but it is subjectively very important if you are the observer.  This scenario is Dennett's (and to some extent Everett's). Since the question doesn't even make sense when formulated in the third person perspective, the answer to this question does not lie in the position and velocities of any atoms. You might conclude that this question doesn't make any sense. But, in any case, the answer to this question is 1 bit of subjective information which both copy 1 and copy 2 know, and which the original observer does not. In the objective third person view, there is no information gained- you know that copy 1 will say \"\"I am copy 1\"\" and copy 2 will say \"\"I am copy 2\"\".  To give an example of actual OR and SYNTH, I'll go beyond Dennett's example: suppose that the copying goes on indefinitely, so that the cloning keeps happening again and again. Then it is very difficult to say what it feels like for the observer, from the first person perspective. For example, take a star-trek duplicator, and duplicate the observer, and then duplicate each duplicate, but add a twist: the duplicator keeps the data from the first duplication event in its memory banks, and makes a third copy in the exact same state twenty years later, and starts duplicating that observer too in the same way. And then it does so again forty years later, then sixty years later. What is the subjective experience? From a naive counting perspective, I should predict that I would be nearly certainly teleported in time to some distant future point, because the number of future copies of my present state is vastly greater than the two present copies. On the other hand, the total number of observers descended from the current duplicates will always outnumber the observers descended from the future duplicates. So perhaps the right counting is by the number of descendents at each time slice, rather than by the total number of descendents of my present state. Even worse, how can my subjective experience change depending on whether somebody millions of years in the future turns off the darned duplicator? (Boltzmann's brain is a similar idea).  \"\n",

      "\", 16 December 2010 (UTC) I'm sorry to disagree but, at Wikipedia, secondary sources trump primary sources.  This seeming contradiction to your experience with academic papers actually makes perfect sense when you understand the rationale.  When you write an academic paper using primary sources, you are performing \"\"original research\"\" based on your understanding of the sources.  Whether your work is respectable and legitimate enough to be considered by the academic community is based on some sort of peer review (usually a peer-reviewed journal or an editor at a respectable publishing company).  Wikipedia has no such mechanism for vetting submissions and so it relies on the concept of a verifiable reliable source which, in plain English, means \"\"a published source which has been through some kind of peer-review process\"\".  If a Wikipedia editor writes text that is based primarily on primary sources, he is vulnerable to the charge of performing \"\"original research\"\".  All we can say is \"\"Unknown Wikipedian X believes A, B and C based on his own interpretation of the primary sources.\"\"  If we cite a secondary source, at least we can say \"\"Published author Y asserts A, B and C based on his peer-reviewed interpretation of the primary sources.\"\"  There is still room to debate how reliable \"\"published author Y\"\" is (he could represent a fringe POV, for instance).  However, in such a debate, Wikipedians bring more information from other secondary sources to either assert or refute the reliability of \"\"Published author Y\"\".  The basic principle here is \"\"not published => not reliable\"\".  And self-published doesn't count.    18:09\"\n",

So Freud deserves a long and thorough article in Wikipedia.  I believe that a balanced article would include A) explanations of Freud's theories, and B) the status of Freudianism today.  The existing article is quite thorough on \"\"A\"\" and had almost nothing on \"\"B\"\".  A neophyte who read the article as it stood a month ago would imagine that Freud's work has the same relation to current psychology that Darwin's work has to current biology.    Let's compare them:  Darwinism thoroughly permeates modern biology, and his fundamentals, built on copious observation and collegial collaboration, now much extended with new data and new theories, continue to provide accurate predictions and fruitful avenues of exploration.  Freud's fundamental ideas were founded on minimal and dubious observations, and his theories do not meet the test of being logical, minimal, reproducible explanations of the data.  As far as Jung goes, I haven't gotten to him yet  ), and I don't know anything about Maslow.  Freud draws my fire precisely because he is so high profile, so influential, and so wrong.  I was required to study The Interpretation of Dreams in high school as if it were scientific fact, and the disgust I felt when I later realized it was all as stupid as it sounded has turned me into - yes - a Freud critic.  Of course, I am striving for NPOV.  Do you really feel that presenting Freud's pseudoscience without comment is NPOV, whereas quoting one of many eminent critics is not?   21:55, 14 Sep 2003 (UTC)\"\n",

She does not; she dropped out of the UC Davis doctoral program in Geology in the mid-1980's. I have an e-mail from the Department confirming that fact.

      "\", 16 October 2007 (UTC)  ________________  Removed from \"\"THEOLOGY\"\" portion as it does not fit the title. Please discuss whether this fits under critism or political headings.  In many respects, the Jewish Messiah becomes nothing but a catalyst, even a figurehead, for Paulinism's own agenda. Paul's new religion had the advantage over other salvation-cults of being attached to the Hebrew Scriptures, which Paul reinterpreted as forecasting the salvific death of Jesus. This gave Pauline Christianity an awesome authority within the period culture that proved attractive to Gentiles thirsting for salvation. MacCoby, Hyam, The Mythmaker, Paul and the Invention of Christianity (ISBN 0-06-0155825)  A.N. Wilson, among others, contends  that Paul invented the Eucharist A.N Wilson, Paul:The Mind of the Apostle. (The contention that the eucharist originates in the religion of Mithras has been widely canvassed since at least the 2nd century when Justin Martyr disputed the allegation .)  He argues, likewise,  (ibid.)  that the idea of justification by faith was his and which can be contrasted with passages in the gospel and elsewhere where doing the will of God is paramount. 'Not everyone who says to me \"\"Lord, Lord\"\", will enter the kingdom of Heaven but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven.' - Matthew 7:21)cf. James 2:18ff    Those who characterize the tenets of Catholic Christianity as \"\"Pauline\"\" compare it with its alternatives, beliefs that Christian theologians called heresies.  It is argued that the Paulines were responsible for the marginalisation of James, the leader of the Jerusalem church, in favour of Peter. The small scattered Jewish Jerusalem Church was disbanded in 135 with the banishment of the Jews from the region by the Romans, having been decimated during the Jewish revolt of 66-70AD.   19:10\"\n",

So why not pick a perfectly standard word that avoids ANY ambiguity?  And contrary to Skyring's fake usage claims, \"\"winningest\"\" is a perfectly standard word:   The Grammarist: Most participial adjectives are made comparative and superlative with more and most. For example, we say more troubling and most sickening instead of troublinger and sickeningest. So, to many English-speakers, the superlative adjective winningest—meaning having the most wins—sounds wrong. And indeed some peevish grammarians hate the word. Yet despite the existence of grammatically unquestionable alternatives (most winning, best), winningest is deeply entrenched in sports commentary and is not going away any time soon. Those who dislike it might as well get used to it.  Google News searches show winningest has been common since the 1940s, and there are scattered examples from earlier. The word has always been confined mainly to American and Canadian publications. (This is also confirmed by Google Ngram)  My copy of the OED 2nd Edition  while it doesn't have usage notes  uses \"\"winningest\"\" in three of their example quotes for the \"\"winning\"\" entry.

      "It is clear to me that Wikipedia is not a reliable source of info, a lot of reviews, media, people in the know give the warning that Wikipedia can not be trusted. I see that with my own eyes now, and before I get out (and never visit this website) I want to make a suggestion regarding your “strict” policy regarding verifiable source of info. I understand that policy to be applied for well-known topics that have been written about in many media sources. I think is a non-sense, a disservice to users asking that policy to be applied to a trivial, un-known, insignificant topic like www.softpedia.com.  Where somebody can find such “verifiable” sources? Should we go and ask media, Web-security companies, PC magazine to rate web-sites like this every year or so? Allowing only one point of view (theirs), given them the liberty to publicize what and  how they are doing their thing and not allowing another point of view, a “check” to agree/disagree to their saying, I don’t think that is correct and conform to what big Jimbo thinks that Wikipedia should stand for.\n",

The two COS's that you mention in support of your argument are clearly work against you. In the James Baker article, who is far more notable than Emaneuel, it says that his father was a lawyer. That's it.  In the John H. Sununu article it states his father's profession and where he was from. Also more than this article. In Alexander Haig, a 4 star general and far more notable than Emanuel, there is nothing on his father. In H. R. Haldeman, it says that his father donated money to the Republican party. If that is your basis for the inclusion of a discussion of his father's activities it is pretty weak. Firstly, there is no wikilink that would resolve this addition like [Irgun]]. Secondly, its not a POV.

Yes, I know these pages were short and lacked content, but you must know it takes time to write a long and informative page on wikipedia. I'm just trying to contribute and I don't know why I'm having such a hard time doing it.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)   I'm not sure that edits such as this back up your claim of \"\"just trying to contribute\"\" and neither do the three 'articles' which you created this afternoon which were, as you know were just made up nonsense - example \"\"If Plato was a Christian this is what his philosophy would be called\"\". QED.  talk     飞天号航天服 & 飞天 deletion   Hi,  you deleted 飞天号航天服 & 飞天  I think these qualify under  since they are the original language names for the article in question (Feitian space suit), so are indeed likely search terms. If someone read an article and copypasted or typed in the original name, shouldn't they be able to reach the correct article?     You used CSD reason R3  \"\"Recently created redirects from implausible typos or misnomers. However, redirects from common misspellings or misnomers are generally useful, as are redirects in other languages.\"\" This says \"\"redirects in other languages are generally useful\"\"     Hi there, this is a difficult one & I can see both sides of the coin. I've tried to see if there is a consensus by looking through Category:Redirects from alternative languages but I'm still not sure. I have always read the \"\"redirect from another language as being more related to things such as Kyiv (topical one that one - read the talk page! - but I digress), or Das Wohltemperirte Clavier rather than a literal transalation of every article's name in to other languages, particulary those with non-Latin character sets.  This is why I feel that the two (Mandarin?) words/phrases you have mentioned equally fall in to the territory of unlikely/implausible phrases for a person to type on the English language Wikipedia. But the bottom line is that I am one admin & one opinion (which is a valid opinion but equally is far from unchallengable). The redirects were speedily deleted so as there was no deletion discussion there is no community consensus for their deletion which means that you are free to recreate. If they are renominated for deletion I will recuse myself from the process and we'll see what others think. Sound OK to you? Kind regards,  talk  Well, there's the essay Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Redirects from foreign languages . The article's name is a phonetic and literal translation of the actual name. (ie. It's a chinese spacesuit, the actual name is in chinese, not English).  From the bit about non-Latin characters, doesn't that indicate bias, since English is used in Hong Kong as an official language, where Chinese characters are prevalent, or India, where non-Latin script is common and English is widely used.

Pezzi admitted it in a public interview, whose reference was already in the article. Fr. Pezzi, with Kiko and Carmen, is in the main equipe of the Way; with Kiko and Carmen signs letters to the Pope (cfr. letter of 17 Jan 2006), etc. The Statute is not an approval. The Statute is a temporary (up to June 2007) guideline. The Statute is an incomplete guideline because it often refers to an unpublished Catechetical Directory (cf. Statute articles 11, 19, 28§2, etc). The most famous papal pronouncement about the Way is on a letter to mgr. Cordes on August 1990 (letter addressed to Cordes, not to Kiko), where he says \"\"I acknowledge the Way\"\" but these words are preceded by \"\"having seen the documentation you sent me, welcoming the request address to me\"\". The Statute was given by Pontifical Council for the Laity, not by John Paul II. Also, in the days following publication of the Statute, John Paul II did not mention in his Angelus and speeches. His first mention will come months after. Popes can change their mind about the Way. Popes can change their mind, if the Way doesn't obey to the Pope. Most recent documents show liturgy issues up to end of 2005. There are some serious concerns. Discussions about the Way are about heresies, obedience, liturgy... Only Roman Catholic hierarchy has the right to correct and guide the Way. \"\"Factoid\"\" about st. Pius from Pietrelcina is actually documented by fr. Enrico Zoffoli, in a book and public letters to some Italian Cardinals and Bishops. In the worst case, it's realistic that st. Pius, who was confessor for people from lots of countries (including U.S. people from nearest NATO base), knew something about Kiko movement in Madrid between 1964 and 1967. The temporary Statute was artificially elevated to highest \"\"We're Approved\"\" Neocatechumenal propaganda. Gennarini, the chief of the Way in the U.S., did actually give a \"\"Neocatechumenal spin\"\" interpretation, documented also by Jimmi Akin. Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi were thanking for \"\"granting a period of two years\"\", but Benedict XVI decisions about that \"\"widespread manner\"\" were timed «not exceeding two years». That is: Benedict XVI wants to solve quickly the problem, but Kiko, Carmen and Pezzi do not. \"\"Note: the echoes were never put in place of the homily, or meant to sound like one\"\": this valuable sentence tries to \"\"explain\"\" in Neocatechumenalspeak the \"\"decision of the Holy Father\"\" to require homily only from deacons and priests. On the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue «giving peace as done in the Early Church» - everyone can verify that the original text of Arinze's letter does not contain such words. Why do Neocatechumenals need a distort and falsified citation? Correct text was: «on the exchange of peace, permission is granted to the Neocatechumenal Way to continue using the indult already granted, pending further instructions» (please note: indult - that is: special permission - and pending further instructions - that is: the indult is temporary). The \"\"NPOV\"\" tag was the last resort of some Neocatechumenal people fearing the truth. Please stop this ugly \"\"edit war\"\". Wiping out documented sources won't change the facts.   \"\n",

Thanks.   |  Talk 22:08, July 19, 2005 (UTC) Vandal activity down since you left Rick, it's interesting to note that since you left, vandalism on Wikipedia has gone down. It's clear that you and those like you simply act to frustrate and abuse legitimate users, whose angry responses can be classed as vandalism, giving you an increased sense of self importance. We don't need that, we need more quality editors, not more volunteer vigilantes.   That's the biggest absurd I've ever heard.  Indeed; it is my impression there is considerably more vandalism now. The edits of the sockuppet above would be one small example. (talk)  Indeed.  I've blocked more in the last day than in the previous 18 months as an admin, which can only be due to the \"\"RickK and Heph gap\"\". Complaining about RickK and Heph is like having an allergy and wishing you didn't have an immune system.   |  Talk 18:40, July 20, 2005 (UTC)  I find it hard to believe one editor (even one so prolific as RickK) can have much of an effect overall. Do contributors on either side have any (non-anecdotal) evidence that suggests otherwise?  Pete  If memory serves, Angela did a survey a while back (Feb or March of 2004) where she sampled the number of blocks each admin had given. Rickk had almost as many as the next 3 people combined.  19:19, July 20, 2005 (UTC) Personally? I frequently saw his edits, and he left a useful note on my talk page correcting me for something.    Isn't it obvious to everyone?  RickK created a whole entourage of sockpuppets, then vandalised with them, then blocked them.  Just to fulfill his self-aggrandising dreams.  He made fools of us all, just to prove that he was brilliant.  Don't you hate him?  Kill RickK, kill RickK, kill RickK'''!    I can safely say that ever since RickK's departure, I have been faced with reverting five times the vandalism I did prior, which still dosen't come close to his legendary vandal fighting, troll combatting, and trash disposing.   Nonsense! I wish him and his many sockpuppets stay out!    To Raul654, now that I can believe ). Statistics on the effect of handing out bans liberally would be great to have.  Pete   My experience in the Wikiworld has shown RickK to be abusive of other users, authoritarian, consistently reverting other peoples edits without apparent reason and unwilling to join a debate on a given subject when his arguments were confronted.

So once again, i have to explain it to you like a kid with limited understanding. 1. The same image is on the Mumbai Rajdhani Page as being at Mumbai Central station. So unless you have come up with a miracle that converts Mumbai into Surat,you are wrong. 2. The image has been taken in bright sun light. 12951 Rajdhani Express arrives at Surat between 1937-1942 hrs so unless you have come up with another miracle & ensured bright sunlight at that time. Daylight may exist but not of such intensity. 3.If you would have ever visited Surat railway station, you would know that the layout of the station is very different from what the image claims. 4.The building in the background is far taller than what buildings in Surat are. Take a ride in the local trains of Mumbai & you may be able to see the same building there but in your case i have my doubts.

      "\"  I think there is possibly scope for a separate article.  For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by \"\"rectangular coordinate system\"\".  But assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    \"\n",

Again I repeat No one is claiming:  Byzantiums invented the symbol. Byzantiums are the only ones to use the symbol. Mehmet II and the Ottomans definately copied the flag.  So there is no need to drown the small section in repeated attempts to show that a turk at some point passed through a nation that had used the symbol at some point as a hopeless counter.  What is being claimed:  The flag of Byzantium, crescent moon and star was flying over Byzantium when as the Turks arrived to lay siege. Byzantium was the first state to use the symbols as national state symbols.  The fact that symbol is old has nothing to do with the Byzantium theory. It is about how the Turks came to adopt the symbol, not who invented it.  It is already stated  above (please read this carefully, i will repeat) It is already stated that the symbol has ancient roots above the section on Byzantium.  What this article is about is not how the Byzantiums got the symbol unfortunately for your nationalism, but how the Byzantiums used this symbol and how it is highly plausible as THE ONLY STATE TO FIRST USE THE SYMBOLS AS NATIONAL SYMBOLS, the Turks borrowed the symbols. Whether the Turks traveled through Places Greeks also went through has no bearing as this section is clearly about how when Istanbul was sieged, the only side using the symbols were the Byzantiums.  This however is obviously criptic to you and I am sure you will repeat your line about how Turks traveled through Babylon as some bizarre hope that it is relevant under this specific Byzantium section.

It looks wonderful now. I appreciate that very much.     Triple Crown and Grand Slam Champions   I am not and was never looking to start trouble, all I am trying to do is expand a definition based on fact and references.  The Triple Crown and the Grand Slam are what we have been going back and forth on.  My contention is that The Intercontinental and United States Championships are equal and thus are interchangeable when when deciding a Crown/Slam.  You say no because WWE never explicitly came out and said so.  On 8-4-06, JBL said he was a Slam winner.  A WWE wrestler on WWE TV said he accomplished a WWE sanctioned feat.  It was said that no outside source has verified this, but no one in WWE has disputed JBL's claim either.  Also it must be pointed out that PWI has always considered the two championships as equal.  When PWI used to do their rankings for WWF and WCW, the I-C and U.S. Titles were always listed as automatic number one contenders for their respective World Champions.  The same holds true today when they do the rankings for Raw (I-C) and Smackdown (U.S.).  PWI is considered the main source for what is considered a \"\"World Title\"\" and their word is law here on Wikipedia.  They also have always maintained that the I-C and U.S. Championships are of equal value and of equal standing.  As I have said before, I am not trying to vandalize or add nonsense to Wikipedia, only enhance it with an updated definition based on consensus and fact, based on logic and references.  JBL, PWI, and many other wiki users have backed up this definition. (Look at the Triple Crown Champion Discussion page).

Petergans (talk)   Both conventions are common and are often a source of debate. The group 3 element article tries to explain the story. Itub (talk)   Common? I've never seen it. Lu is a lanthanide in all the standard inorganic texts, Greenwood & Earnshaw, Cotton & Wilkinson, Housecroft & Sharpe, Shriver & Atkins ... The debate was concluded long ago. Petergans (talk)   Just last month there was an article published in J. Chem. Ed. continuing the debate (advocating La and Ac in group 3), and it cites a few books and articles that follow the opposite convention. See [1]. There are also four letters about this topic in the same issue.[2] Itub (talk)   Unbelievable! In 50 years as a chemist I have never, until yesterday, seen a periodic table with Lu anywhere other than in the lanthanide series. Web elements is a first for me and, as far as I'm concerned, just another example of nonsense on the web. IUPAC puts La under Y. There is no ambiguity about it, just that the lanthanide series convertionally starts with La and is usually written separately. Petergans (talk)   This is not nonsense on the Web. There have been many textbooks published since the 1980s that put Lu under Y (I can't say whether they are the majority or the most influential). Just one example: Wulfsberg's Inorganic Chemistry. Wulfberg explains his reasoning in a footnote. In this letter to JCE, the authors looked at 35 textbooks for what they call \"\"flyleaf periodic tables\"\". If you look at the figure in the letter, among the textbooks published since 1984, 7 put La under Y, 7 put Lu, and 2 put all 15 lanthanides like IUPAC. IUPAC's table is ambiguous. It doesn't put any specific element under Y; it puts all the lanthanides there! Itub (talk)   I'm flabbergasted. I thought elements were put in the same group because they have the same electronic configuration. The trivalent ions of Sc, Y, La, Ac have a noble gas electronic configuration. Lu(III) does not. How can it be put in the same group? (Don't answer that). I stand by the word nonsense!Petergans (talk)   I'll dare to answer despite your request. I'm relatively neutral on this issue because I think it is largely an arbitrary convention, but I enjoy playing devil's advocate. 1) the periodic table predates knowledge of electronic configurations, and sometimes exceptions are made in the name of chemical properties (or even in the name of layout, in my opinion), such as putting helium above neon instead of above beryllium (although some tables do put He above Be!) 2) the relationship between the electronic configurations of Y and La is essentially the same as the one between Al and Ga: Al and Ga are both s2p1, but Ga has a full d shell that Al doesn't have; Y and Lu are both s2d1, but Lu has a full f shell that Y doesn't have. Trivalent Lu also has a noble gas configuration, in the sense of having no s and p electron in the valence shell, same as trivalent gallium. 3) if one looks at the neutral atom, La has the same configuration as Y, but that's an anomaly in that it doesn't follow the aufbau rule. But we don't move elements such as copper and palladium to another group just because they happen to deviate from aufbau. Finally, one slight disadvantage of putting La under Y is that you end up with a discontinuous d block in the long form of the periodic table, which looks a bit odd in my opinion. Itub (talk)   (no indent) The counter to that argument is that, in the spirit of Mendeleev, elements a grouped together because of similarities in chemistry. Therefore it is the electronic configuration in the \"\"group oxidation state\"\" that counts, not the configuration of the atoms. Cu is the classic example [Ar]4s13d10 in the atom, but in Cu(I) the relative energies of 4s and 3d are reversed and it is the s electron which is lost on oxidation of the metal, so Cu sits comfortably in a group with Ag and Au. For Au, the f electrons are discounted as they belong to the filled 4-shell comprising 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f.  We can argue this one for ever, but what concerns me now is that the basic image of the long-form periodic table, which is used in WP for all the elements, puts Sc and Y above Lu and presents La and Ac as a group on their own. I believe that this is misleading as it does not clearly distinguish the lanthanide and actinide series from the main-group elements and transition metals. long-form periodic\n",

The claims she makes above lack credibility. The link to Williams' own web site simply contains more of her unfounded rantings. Williams seems to understand so little about Wikipedia that she does not understand that Andrea James is NOT the author of the Wikipedia biography about her. The information about the colleges  Andrea James has attended and her degrees from them are well known and easily verified facts. The other facts in the Andrea James biography are also easily verified. There is no requirement that Andrea James provide documentation about the biography of her to Wikipedia editors. If Ms. Williams were at all credible, it would be her responsibility to produce notarized letters from Wabash College and the University of Chicago that Ms. James did not receive degrees from them. Ms. James is a well known author, film maker, and activist whose laudable efforts are well documented. Ms. James activities are also well documented by national magazines, newspapers, and television appearances. Ms. Williams has no such credibility. The evidence is clear, from Ms. Williams infantile response above, and her infantile behavior on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet that her beliefs are the product of some form of delusion on her part. Kimberly Williams does not appear to be someone with any intention of providing an appropriate contribution to the Wikipedia.\n",

It is fine to say that there have been confirmed instances of ambulances and fleeing civilians being hit, but to use language like \"\"clearly marked\"\" and \"\"prominently waving white flags\"\" is completely unacceptable and should be removed.  Also, I will request again that some mention be made of Hezbollah's use of warheads filled with ball bearings (whihc are designed to maximize human casualties).  All mention of this was removed, apparently by POV vandals.  The part about the ball bearings was moved down and is now next to the part about Hezbollah using civilians as human shields, I believe.  \"\n",

Unless you can find a secondary source showing that the Rolling Stones were using it to refer to the subculture, then you don't have a dispute.  We don't do original research.  The Fallon citation isn't sourced to Fallon: it's found in multiple sources that make that claim.  Take a look at the citation in the Hippie article: Perry 2005, p. 19; Sinclair, Mick. (2004) San Francisco: A Cultural and Literary History. Signal Books. p. 205. ISBN 1902669649; Singleton, Carl. Wildin, Rowena. (1999). The Sixties in America. Salem Press. p. 334.

      "\"  Reply  First, the \"\"tens of thousand\"\" more heavy oil than lightr crude is false. To get this figure, you probably included all organic content in the lithosphere, as if there was a remote chance to gzet anything usable from a 5 km deep shale with 1% of kerogen. You got confused \"\"light oil\"\", and \"\"conventionnal oil\"\". what you categorized as \"\"low-grade oil\"\" is, for a large part, not oil at all (kerogen).   Second, there is a important notion you ignored  net energy yeld. The vast majority of low grade fossil \"\"fuels\"\", like deep oil shale, would consume more energy to extract than they would give. Already, the Athabasca oil sands have a self-consumption of about 30% - that could be reduced to some 25% with advanced technology. The small-sclae oil shale projects that were teste had a near-zero net energy yields - except in estonia, but the shales they used were among the richest known.  Third, extraction rate is as important as reserves. Non conventionnal oil (biodegraded oil, bitumen, oil heavier than water...) is very difficult to take out. Kerogen from shale is even worst. Even if these ressources are in the trillions of barrels, they won't provide much help if we can only get a few million barrels out per day.  Fourth, non-conventionnal has an high environmental cost. CO2 emeissions on a full-cycle basis (from well to end use) are much higher. There are other problems like the destruction of ecosystems (for open-pit production of both oil shale of oil sands), water use (especially for oil shale), water pollution, disposal of wastes (for oil shales)... These environmental costs would become catastrophic is non-conventional production was to be upscaled to the same range of output than current conventional production.\"\n",

      "Extended comments about this The comments by BritishWatcher show the problems at present.  I gave him a simple choice, assume good faith and take me at my word, or buy the book. Instead he chose option C, whine and assume bad faith.  He asserts I have not provided an alternate text written from the source instead of the current text. If he had bothered to read the discussion, he would realise I have said more than once that it is not possible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. So I cannot do that.  The problems are quite simple:  The original sentence which was copied to the lead (complete with egregious modifications of the original sentence to mean something completely different!) did not match the source, and is therefore unsourced. It is impossible to construct an accurate, non-misleading sentence that belongs in the lead of the article from that source. Various editors have produced no sources at all to support any figures about injuries or opinions they have said should be included in the lead. Various editors refuse to allow an unsourced (as the text does not match the source in any way) sentence to be removed from the article. They are so insistent on retaining an incorrect, unsourced sentence. Not only that, they keep proposing equally incorrect, unsourced sentences that either cite zero sources or inaccurately cite the existing source. I have asked many times why the reader should be misled. It is quite telling that nobody dare give me a straight policy based answer to that question, especially when the protection policy allows for its removal.  When one side's discussion involves nothing more than assumptions of bad faith, stalling, stonewalling and making things up from thin air, it is obvious where the problem lies.\n",

      "Hello, everyone. I have read that many of you are unsatisfied with articles in wiki that do not reflect accuracy in information. Such articles are produced by authors who have manifested a tendency towards some bias. In the great majority of the cases, the bias is personal. In other cases, the bias is based upon false information. Despite the info contributors presented - along with their solid references - they were completely ignored and their sources deleted without proper review by the authors. In such cases, the actions of these authors were somehow upheld and defended by wiki editors. Therefore, I have decided to create an article that yields as much accuracy as possible without any personal leanings. This is what wikipedia is is meant to be, which we all know is a long departure from what it is doing now. If any of you would like to contribute to this article, you are free to do so.

It strongly wanted annexation to the US (for military protection and for access to the US sugar market) The Democrats strongly opposed annexation of Hawaii (and the Philippines) because they did not want Asiatics. The Republicans were much more liberal on race and wanted an empire, hence bases in Hawaii. The Democrats blocked a treaty (needed 2/3 vote) so the Republicans voted annexation by resolution (50% vote), just as texas had been annexed by resolution in 1845.  They offered citizenship to all citizens of Hawaii (most of them non-white) and set up elections. The heir to the old throne Prince Kuhio  was elected as a Republican to Congress in 1902.\n",

Aside from a few religious fundamentalists who somehow feel that evolution challenges their beliefs...  The antievolutionists are in the same camp as people who believe in extraterrestrials abducting people or cows, or in the Loch Ness Monster, or ghosts, or vampires, or avoiding black cats, or any number of other unfounded beliefs that people adopt.  ...and nonbelievers in evolution  Should an article on NASA have a big section on UFOs and UFO abduction of farm animals?

What you are proposing is to completely delete everything from the article representing the view of majority of Iranians and the government that the elections were not rigged and leave the article with only green movement propaganda. Firtsly I want to make it clear there was no real proof at all, the \"\"proof\"\" provided were: a comparison of Ahmadinejad's 2005 first round results per province (in which 7 major candidates competed and none had a majority) with his 2009 results per province, which ofcourse showed and increase for Ahmadinejad votes everywhere and than the claim that this should be impossible, which \"\"proves\"\" Mousavi won. A claim by Mousavi office that the \"\"actual results\"\" leaked and showed him with 19 milion votes and Ahmadinejad with only 5 milion votes which contradicts the green movement's claims that the eelection results weren't counted at all, because the results were in (supposedly) much to quickly, which is their other \"\"major proof\"\" that the results were rigged. Another \"\"proof\"\" is the myth of \"\"all Azeris would automaticly vote for Mousavi, disregaring all politics and voting purely on ethnic basis\"\" (which should \"\"prove\"\" that the election was rigged as Ahmadinejad won in Tabriz), but at the same time the Persians are not gonna vote ethnicly for some reason unknown to us, infact they were all gonna vote for Mousavi the non-Persian. Other than these flawed theories presented by the Green movement you've got a few claims by them that anonymous government workers have admitted the election was rigged, the problem being that none of this can ever ben confirmed and the assumption that the fact that 100,000 people demonstrated in a city of 14,000,000 (metropolian area) - although nowhere else in the country the Greens could get over 1000 people - should make everyone believe that it is sooo obviously clear tha a vast majority of Iran's 74 milion people support this man. And all of these weak claims are mentioned throughout all articles related (and even articles hardly related) to the elections and/or green movement. Now if this is the only \"\"proof\"\" they have (which it is), why would pro-American governments and the media in their country's take it all so seriously? Simple, politics are politics. There has been a smear-campaign against Ahmadinejad, in western media ever since he got in power and against Iran ever since the revolution, because the Iranian politics do not coincide with American geo-strategic interests. Why do you think their camera crews prior to the elections only interviewed university students in Northern Tehran which spoke fluent English, while no other city, region or population group's views were ever shown on American news? Because they wanted to create an image that Mousavi is more populair, while infact he wasn't, as the fully legitimate results show.     \"\n",

Turtlescrubber    \"\"give opportunity for the other side to justify why Pelosi is wrong on this issue\"\"? This is not the POV by Nancy Pelosi or US House of Representatives Committee, but a tragic event recognized by the most of democratic societies and countries.

Andranikpasha   Andranikpasha, your nickname expalins who are you? YOu are an armenianorigin person. Andranik indeed has been one ot he heads of the bloody Armenian militia killing Turks, Kurds and Azeris, with his terrorist acts has been the reason for the reaction of Kurds, Turks and Azeris after they returned from the war in 5 fronts. So your response is absolutly biased, because of your nationality and firm belief in an event that never occured or occurded only for the Armenian church who uses this so called armenian genocide to mobilzie armenians and prevent their assimilation.  As to the fact this is not the page for the other side, this shows how much you are anti-democratic and biased on this issue. This is against the Wikip3edia neturality principle as well. You give one side an opportunity to jsutify her action, but the other side only one general and useless sentence. I wouldn't be surprised if you are a pro-Pelosi person. Please, don't accuse others with stupidity and etc. I know quite a lot about American politics and how it is run. I completed my studies in US. This is for your education and information.  If I don't see any more jsutified response I will go an and extent the Turkey section and also create the Criticism section. Raman, Massachusetts —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk)   The section is grossly biased in favor of Pelosi-s pro-armenian stance and justification. She wants to sell something which didn't happen due to funds she receive from the Armenian lobby.  She wants to compare the armenian killings with those of Jews genocide and Rwanda genocide. She forgets following differences between these events.   Nationalist Armenians were at war with the Turks in 1915 (both in Anatolia and Caucausus), and the Armenian generals and guerilla leaders who commanded them are still honored as Armenian heroes today. Military leaders like Generals Andranik Oznanian, Garegin Nzhdeh, Drastamat Kanahyan (“General Dro”), and Garo Pasdirmaijan (“Armen Garo”) are largely unknown to Americans whose knowledge of Armenian history is limited to the orthodox genocide literature, but well-known by Armenians. Here, again, the analogy to the Jews of the Holocaust simply does not fit. There are no statues to the Jewish generals who fought the Nazis in Germany in 1942-43, because there were none.   And there is such a biased section on Turkey. the editor andranik, an armenian by origin, who carries the name of the armenian terrorist and nationlist milita head accuses\n",

Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.  The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.  ==\n",

      "\"  (Ivo Banac)...A bit of nonteleological history One of the great problems is that our understanding of the common and individual histories of the South Slavs and the other peoples of southeastern Europe has not significantly benefited from critical historiography. This is because nationalist historiographies regularly have explained modern developments as an aspect of unilinear design. We have been taught to see connections that may be of our own making. For example, if we look at a current political map of the area and compare it to that from the era of settlements we will see that the present political divisions do not correspond to those from the early medieval period. Croatia is mainly a coastal area from the Rasa River in Istria to the Cetina River, a little bit to the east of the city of Split. Down the coast from the original Croatia, we have a row of unfamiliar Slavic territories that Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, the tenth-century Byzantine emperor-historian, called Pagania (literally, land of the pagans), Zachlumia (most of present-day eastern Herzegovina, with the Croatian peninsula of Peljesac), Terbounia (the Trebinje area of eastern Herzegovina, with Dubrovnik and its eastern coastal environs), and Dioclea (the southern portions of contemporary Montenegro with the Bay of Kotor and the northwesternmost portions of present-day Albania around Lake Skadar/Shkoder). Serbia is located in the hinterland of Zachlumia, Terbounia, and Dioclea, its center around Ras, near today's Novi Pazar, in the Sandzak. Bosnia was apparently within this territory, but represented a negligible area around the source of the Bosna River, where we now find Sarajevo and its environs. And Dalmatia? In the tenth-century this was a necklace of Byzantine-ruled Roman coastal cities and island territories, from Krk in the north to Ulcinj in the south.  Moreover, modern territoriality required a tradition that was itself a product of modernity. Thus, unrelated traditions were merged to produce an idea of ethnic-as opposed to cultural-continuity. The Croat historical tradition goes back to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a twelfth-century text from Bar in contemporary Montenegro) and its various translations (for example, Marko Marulic, 1510), which were in turn incorporated into the Early Modern \"\"Slavic\"\" and \"\"Dalmatian\"\" histories of Mavro Orbin (1601) and Ivan Lucic (Ioannes Lucius, 1666). These works then became material for the Croatianizing work of Pavao Ritter Vitezovic (Croatia rediviva, 1700), who was the most important influence on the revivalist generation of Ljudevit Gaj (1809-1872) and that of postrevival integral nationalists like Ante Starcevic (1823-1896). Curiously, the same histories (Orbin's) were Serbianized through the translations of Sava Vladislavic (1722), which then influenced the pioneering Serbian histories of Jovan Rajic (1794), and were Bulgarianized in the history of Paisij Hilandarski (1762). The Bosnian historical tradition was somewhat more self-contained. It combined the Franciscan memory of medieval Bosnian statehood with the experiences of Muslim ayan (notable) selfrule to argue for a uninational Bosnia (for example, Antun Knezevic, whose book was published between 1884 and 1887).  Clearly, something has happened in the span of ten centuries. Pagania, Zachlumia, and Terbounia have disappeared. The center of Croatia has migrated from the Adriatic to the north, into medieval Slavonia (literally, Slavic land), with Zagreb at its head. This happened in stages. During the High Middle Ages, the heart of Croatia was on the Una River, now in northwestern Bosnia. This territory (Turkish Croatia) was lost to the Ottomans in the sixteenth century and became a part of Bosnia. During the Habsburg reconquest and the concomitant Venetian operations in the seventeenth century, the framework of modern Croatia emerged in two extended shanks-one, to the north, to modern Slavonia; the other, in the south, in modern Dalmatia. At the same time, the Zagreb area, which was only dubiously Croatian in the early Middle Ages, became the heart of modern Croatia.  The story of Serbia is not much different. Serbia first migrated to the coast and assimilated Dioclea. Then it moved to the Ibar-Morava valleys; then toward the valleys of Struma and Vardar in Macedonia. It reached the Danube only as an Ottoman vassal in the fifteenth century. And its modern capital, Belgrade, became truly Serbian only in the course of Karadjordje's uprising in 1806. Bosnia, too, expanded under Ban (or prorex) Kulin (r. 1180-1204) into the Donji Kraji (literally, Lower Lands) around the Vrbas River and the Soli (literally, Salt Lands; for centuries, Ottoman, then modern Tuzla) and Usora, in its present northeastern corner. Later on, at the height of its power in fourteenth century, Bosnia expanded into Hum (Herzegovina) and the Drina River valley. The westernmost regions were inc\n",

      "\"== Early Chicago computer club == Hi, thanks for all your efforts!!!  Not sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page.   AFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange.   I believe there was a meeting approx Apr '75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a \"\"Digital Systems\"\" original 8080 \"\"box\"\" - and the CP/M operating system.    (Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it).   The \"\"hobby\"\" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics.   [Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).    SO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked.   MY involvement with the club was to be an \"\"active participant\"\" in that for ex. I was sec'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system.   My home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to \"\"produce outputs that matched that timing\"\", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)  My machine also  once \"\"video\"\" became available (I skipped the \"\"TV Typewriter\"\" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first).   THEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don't recall now.)  I modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The \"\"Tarbell\"\" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the \"\"CACHE Cassette Operating System\"\" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.    SO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the \"\"boards\"\" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a \"\"board\"\" - I think so and the little Sinclair \"\"pocket calculator\"\" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.    When the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought \"\"this is the end of the hobby\"\".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a \"\"built\"\" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I'm sure the \"\"Hams\"\" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to \"\"talk over the air\"\"..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much \"\"burned out\"\" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area.   ____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?    Just to \"\"come to a better close\"\"  the fact I'd done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to \"\"beep\"\" things back and forth with friends;   Then the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be \"\"by committee\"\" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by  (talk • contribs)    (\n",

      "\"   Celine Dion Signings   Please do not change Celine's signings in the infobox. The infobox should only pertain to signings and not imprints traced to the artist around the world. The reason why Celine was imprinted with Columbia and not Epic in Europe and Canada is because her catalog is actually sold by her original signee, Sony Music Canada, who uses the Columbia label. The content creator on the other hand is pic records up till 2007, and 2007 onward Columbia Records. Columbia Records as a standalone company exists in two places: NYC (original standalone company for many decades) and London (a division of Sony Music UK). Every other \"\"Sony Music (insert country name here)\"\" company uses it as an A&R; imprint, they don't operate actual companies or standalone divisions called Columbia. Celine's first sony affiliate signing was in 1986 to CBS Records Canada, (CBS became Sony globally on jan 1, 1991), and Sony Music Canada used the Columbia logo on her (worked with the \"\"columbia\"\" a&r; team at Sony Canada). Then Celine went on to sign with Sony affiliates in the US, but in the US they operate as standalone companies since there's many of them (there's just not one central \"\"sony music\"\" company). However, even though she signed other sony deals in another country, her original signee (sony music canada) is still the worldwide sales agent of her work, and hence passed along their \"\"columbia\"\" item to europe sony affiliates. Notice in the infobox it indicates she is still on sony music canada, because for as long as she's involved with sony in the US, she is still tied to sony canada. Furthermore, even without this explanation, it is irrelevant what label is used in other markets where the artist isn't signed for the infobox. For example, in Japan, Sony does NOT have the rights to the Columbia trademark, hence every single Sony artist ever, whether Columbia or any other label, was released there with the Epic imprint instead by Sony Music Japan. Does that mean we go to every sony related artist and insert Epic?? Indeed not. \"\n",

The whole section is *very* subjective, depending entirely on your point of view, and  could be applied to plenty of films from that era. Further, none of the information there was cited. I am posting the section here in its entirety for reference.     Language and Mind-set of a Popular 1950s Musical  Some parts of the film might be considered racy or questionable now, though a recent viewer can place it in the mindset of 1956: Crosby’s character sings a love song to an eleven-year-old girl (his ex-wife’s younger sister who still has quite a crush on him);  the father of the bride discusses the attractiveness of his daughter's body (while upbraiding her for having no compassion, as most characters in the movie have already or soon will);  and several cases of real and imagined extramarital sex (separated from the movie-going masseswho might not at that time be participating in such exercisesby all characters being part of, or by necessity having to interact with the Newport upper class). When Tracy Lord (played by Kelly) awakens hungover on her wedding day, she doesn’t at first remember anything about her previous night’s drunken carousing, but comes to believe she “made love” with Mike the reporter (played by Sinatra) and discusses it at length with her ex-husband Dexter (played by Crosby). At the time, of course, \"\"making love\"\" was generally understood in a more amorous than sexual sense. Being a romantic comedy, “High Society” plays all of this for laughs while cheering for the real loves to uncover themselves by the end of the last reel.  There are also some very interesting issues of class in the movie, as Kittridge, the up-and-coming coal magnate (and fiance to the current mine owner’s daughter), is described as having worked his way up from being a miner, and clearly is flummoxed by the confusing interactions of those born into the upper class, as is Sinatra's journalist character.  \"\n",

From the same site, different article it's back to being founded in 2000. This wiki article alone has 2 different founding dates, 1998 and 2000.  This is very basic information.  All of it comes from Geoff Beckett directly through press releases, interviews, or his own website.  Why do the dates keep changing?  Can any information provided by a citation that has Beckett as it's primary source be considered reliable when he changes his story constantly about something as simple as this?  What is the policy of dealing with information that comes from a person who just doesn't get things right very often?  From the numerous announced release dates that have come and gone with no actual product materializing, to not even getting the founding date of his own company correct, it seems that Geoff Beckett should be considered at least somewhat unreliable whenever he states anything.    And so, can references like the  Washington Times and The Record articles be considered sound when they are going off nothing more than what Geoff Beckett is telling them?    \"\n",

Regrettably, Mr. King (the other) died in the last month, and that has thrown the proverbial monkey wrench into the rankings (Addendum: I assure you I am alive and well).      I would love to at the very least get into the Disambiguation section, however I am afraid I would need a bio for that.... Am I correct?    3) For some reason my ISBN does not seem to work here despite the fact I am on everything from Amazon through the Library Thing....and everything between. Odd, yet I would be delighted if at the very least I could get this to go to either the individual page at Amazon or the title page ( this one:)      Thank you in advance for your valuable time and expertise. I look forward to our next adventure that undoubtedly is awaiting our attention.   CSK (cubaking)\n",

Once again, many Christians, mostly Serbs, fought in his army, including Kraljevic (the son of the king) Marko, the hero of another famous Epic, who died not in that battle, but in the Battle of Arges which Bayezid fought with the Wallachians on May 17, 1395. Mircea appears to have been victorious militarily, but his forces and resources were so depleted that he had to acknowledge the loss of the Dobrudja, into which Bayezid moved Turkish garrisons. He also had to accept the status of an Ottoman vassal and pay regular tribute. This arrangement lasted until the Danubian Principalities regained their independence. Although it created problems for the Romanians, it saved them from the much harsher treatment that went with direct Ottoman rule, especially during the centuries of decline.  \"\n",

The main advantages for this are;  1) The three articles would more accurately represent the history of the lines in question. This article includes the Berks and Hants Railway as well as only a small section of the Bristol to Exeter Railway and the South Devon Railway. Three articles concerning the modern day equivalents of these railways would be a better basis for the articles than the arbitrary cut-offs that are currently employed.  2)The three articles would more accurately tie-in with other articles. For example, the article Disused railway stations (Bristol to Exeter Line) would cover all closed stations from a single article instead of the one and a quarter that it currently does.  3)The articles will more accurately mirror current services, this especially applies to CrossCountry services that only operate between Bristol and Plymouth and South West Trains that only operate between Exeter and Plymouth.

Personally i prefer to copy-n-paste the entire section back and forth between pages, since that assures that the conversation is always up to date and readable for everyone (Whereas only placing responses on other people's talk pages would lead to a fragmented conversation.   Other editors prefer other methods - some just post a reply on every involved parties talk page. Alternatively you can place the Talkback template on another users page to notify them that you left a response for them on your own page (Which is convenient in its own rights, since you can keep the entire conversation on a single page).

Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified.

      "\"  MarshalN20 response Dear AGK, thank you very much for the note you left on my talk page. I am currently busy with work & studies to provide a thorough response, so I will provide a quick list: Lecen submitted the RfM yesterday (from my side of the world). About a day has passed, and yet the user has been frantically badgering people with demands of action (, , , and ). His distraught actions hold no more common sense than a squirrel looking for a nut. Lecen incorrectly claims that I am a user \"\"involved\"\" in the dispute. My only contributions to the article include a copy-edit of the lead () and a reversion of Lecen's vandalism (). The dispute itself is between Lecen and Cambalachero. I am a third party to the dispute. Lecen claims that I am not a third party because I am in favor of Cambalachero's point of view. The people in the Dispute Resolution Noticeboard were mostly (if not all) against Lecen. He conveniently tries to ignore these things, but I think it would be good to make a list of them here: Go Phightins (Mediator, ): \"\"I advocated your position [MarshalN20] and refuted his [Lecen], for the most part, in the DRN.\"\" Amadscientist (commentator, ): \"\"[M]y intitial concern is balance by Lecen. The editor seems to have more than a less than disinterested POV on the subject and it does certainly show in the editors remarks, posts and requests. The first source I found is also the first source prsented in the Third Opinion and appears terribly cherry picked.\"\" Binksternet (commentator, ): \"\"Use WP:ATTRIBUTEPOV to name those who say Rosas was a dictator, and to name those who say he was something else. I don't think it is fruitful to demand that historians be found who say directly 'Rosas was not a dictator'.\"\" Wdford (commentator, ): \"\"It seems to me just from this thread that a number of sources do not regard Rosas as a dictator. On that basis alone, I feel we should have a statement that \"\"some see him as a dictator and others as something else\"\". [...] I would recommend that we therefore mention that both opinions exist re Rosas, and hopefully the article contains enough background as to let the reader understand both perspectives in his original historical context.\"\" Based on all this points, I see no need for any further mediation. Plenty of third opinions have already been provided (including my own) to the dispute between between Lecen and Cambalachero. Lecen asked for third opinions, he got them, and yet continues to game the system looking for someone to agree with him. I kindly request you, AGK, to please stop Lecen from WP:GAMING the system.

I cited the account of Dionysios Thrax which proves the mediae were fricatives but the advocates of the reconstructed pronunciation knowing that it demolished their theory erased it.   I cited the inscriptional record which is the basis of Caragounis research and the dishonest advocates of the reconstructed pronunciation erased that too. And once again you have shown that you have no grasp whatsoever of Semitic linguistics since I have told you often enough that proto-Semitic had both fricative and non-fricative forms of b, d and g (β, δ, γ) as well as f, t, k (φ, θ, χ) which were represented in Phoenician script by letters which were allophones for both. The fricative and non-fricative versions of these sound still existe today in Arabic but in Hebrew the original proto-Semitic fricative became breaths and the non-fricative became fricatives long before Hellenistic times.    As for these sounds in other indo-European languages. Grimm got it wrong as I have prove in the discussion here. . These sounds were originally fricatives since that is the only way German could have undergone the changes it underwent without the sounds of the psila, mediae and dasea being confused.\n",

Founded in 1944, its current music director (as of July 2009) is Larry Rachleff. Based in East Providence, Rhode Island, its performing home is Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence.  In the 1960s, Erich Kunzel served as its assistant conductor.

That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a \"\"kangaroo court\"\" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.  The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.  Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.  So I studied Eleland a little.  I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.  Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.  Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.  Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?  Can anything be done?

If a template like this is to gain acceptance, it needs to be less intrusive.

If you still want to try this, my suggestion would be a collapsible box placed much lower in the article, the way  is placed at the bottom of Miles Davis. However, it might be a good idea to seek feedback on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Songs before putting much work into this. /  ☺ ☭ 17:00, 1 May\"\n",

      "\"  Daniel Vincent Kelley's Theory regarding this phrase First I want to point out that while it is CLAIMED in the article that Marie Antoinette was kind and noble and gracious of the peasants, NOTHING is cited to prove such. The one Antoinette quote that is offered to this end, smacks of sociopathology or her recognition that she would promote her OWN cause, by offering kindness to those who are proving themselves kind to her. There's nothing in the phrase to indicate that she was speaking of the whole of the French people, but it seems she was speaking about some particular people who had been particularly kind to her. Calculating psychopaths can be kind for this reason, so that they will enjoy camaraderie with their aids. So, this statement, that she felt she should be nice to the people who were being nice to her, certainly does NOT certify Marie Antoinette as kind hearted or noble. I suspect, that much as the phrase is thrown around today, it was probably thrown around by the clique of it's originator. They probably had a real laugh, suggesting things the peasants could eat, when they ran out of bread as happened under the leadership of every dictatorial monarchy. Here's how I imagine the phrase came to be said by Marie Antoinette is she heard her royal family, her mom and dad and step parents, maybe her grandparents, talking about what had been said in an age past, when the peasants ran out of food and started eying the national leadership as cause. Then, when she found herself in the situation, she used what was in her circle a cliche, that was widely unknown to the rest of the world. She probably didn't think much of saying it, she probably thought it would be received by her audience as cute and figured it would never get around, never become more widely known that she said it AND probably she hadn't really considered how callous it is when people are starving, to make light of it. So, my guess, is that, EXACTLY as the phrase is thrown around today for it being so pithy and the situation so often endured, peasants starving, Marie-Thérèse originated it, the phrase circulated amongst Royalty for 100 years, probably spoken of at dinner parties how pithy was Marie-Thérèse, how callous and witty and devilishly fun (from the sadistic royal perspective). So Marie-Thérèse originates it, Marie Antoinette's family speaks of it, tells the story. Marie Antoinette happens upon the same situation, bread shortage, she rehashes the phrase originated by Marie-Thérèse. Rouseau writing of it, attributing it to a Princess who he had not heard first hand say it, proves that the phrase was circulating in royal and educated circles. He says some earlier royal said it, presumably she said it to other royals and presumably Rouseau similarly heard it spoken by royals. So, obviously, if Marie-Thérèse said it, 100 years before Rouseau wrote it, obviously the phrase was conveyed by some royal story teller, who probably blathered on and on about all the corruption and hi-jinks those callous witty royals do, for love of reliving the old times and as \"\"lessons\"\" to the young royals on how to live. Marie Antoinette saying it, in royal company, would be like her saying, I'm on your side royal friends. It's basically a slightly witty way for Marie Antoinette to say she doesn't care how the peasants get through their hard times, how the royals deal with the peasants through those hard times, callous, is her intent and plan. It was a way of declaring her loyalty and making light of the situation. Many here have claimed that because Rouseau wrote it before Antoinette could possibly have said it, means that Antoinette never said it. That's OBVIOUSLY nonsense. She OBVIOUSLY didn't originate the phrase, credit Marie-Thérèse, but that wouldn't prevent her from spouting cliche as so many nim wits make habit.\"\n",

KHAN'S PICTURE SHOULD BE THE LAST TO BE DELETED. -srry for the caps, just wanted attention.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)     death   I think there are various explanations on how chinggis died in the different sources. Some say he fell from a horse, others allege a connection to a XiXia princess, one(?) goes into detail and sais that this princess severed the small Genghis. I think incorporating this into the article would be better than leaving it at the current \"\"unknown reasons\"\". I'll try to find the exact citations until tomorrow. Heissig's Ein Volk sucht seine Geschichte should be OK, I assume?      Spelling of name   The article says:  \"\"Genghis\"\" as popularly spelled and pronounced in Western media and text is supposedly derived from the original Persian reports of an invading army, led by a man in 1219 against the Khwarezmid Empire. The Persian people pronounced the man's name \"\"Genghis\"\", as there was no \"\"ch\"\" sound in the Persian tongue. Henceforth, the Persian version of the name of the leader of the Mongol Empire became known and widespread in the Western hemisphere as \"\"Genghis\"\".[citation needed]  This is absolute nonsense.  There is a \"\"ch\"\" sound in Persian (e.g. chahar, four).  The spelling \"\"Genghis\"\" is more likely to have come from Marco Polo attempting to render the sound of Chinese.  It might be worth pointing out that, in that case, the initial G should be pronounced j or zh, and not like \"\"get\"\" as so many people do.     Do we have a source either way? If not, then this kind of speculation is Original Research, and needs to be removed (that's why there is a [citation needed] there in the first place).     I've found a review that attributes the Genghis/Persian theory to Weatherford, and also refutes it based on historical documents. Therefore I've fixed the text in the article to explain that disagreement and pointing to the relevant source.     Genghis is not Western but the English, French and Spanish spelling, note it's written and pronounced with a \"\"ch\"\" [ʧ] in Russian (Ч),  Mongolian (Ч), Tartar (Ç) and also German (Dsch-). The English spelling should follow the Russian, Mongolian and Tartar for this word, IMO.     German pronounciation is actually more like Jingis, with J as in Jungle.     The English name is and remains Genghis. It is not up to Wikipedia to decide whether it \"\"should\"\" be or follow anything different.     Above statement is wrong. Genghis is almost never used in newly published (scholarly) books and articles in English these days. Most common spelling is Chingiz. Chingis also used. Genghis is now reserved for childrens' books and journalists, Wikipedia should change to reflect this.  I have never seen anyone use Chingiz. Chinggis, Činggis etc. yes, but not Chingiz.     Looked at some sources and I was wrong above - Chinggis is most common, followed by Chingis and Chingiz in roughly equal second place. No matter how commonly Genghis is used in English, there's no escaping that it's wrong.     Just repeating such a statement doesn't make it true. What are you verifiable published sources to support such a claim?     Here is one verifiable published source: CIA World Factbook: Mongolia.

      "Polemics, rehashing old claims, fighting over perceived biases and trying to blame each other for whatever will not solve this problem. I perceive that the fundamental premise of the dominant editors holds that any critique of the prevalent analysis in this article must begin and end within the terms set by the proponents of that analysis. This is not logical. To elucidate and support an alternative proposition is not bound by any other disciplines a priori, asserted or even purported evidentiary claims to knowledge. Historical-critical biblical theologians have no automatic nor exclusive claim to authority in this matter. Neutrality in this instance is clear. The article must provide context to the reader about the question, show the various positions and approaches taken in different fields, and ensure that no single claim to exclusive authority or evocation of essentially meaningless and conflictual universal generalisations is present. It can not possibly be any clearer. The article is fundamentally flawed in two ways 1)claims to exclusive authority and 2) circular and self-referential evidentiary support. If we welcome a diversity of perspectives, educate the reader, and all show more respect and dignity to each other we will surely end up with one heck of a great article. What do you think?\n",

I was not isolating to just sex, but the full spectrum, making CSA the most appropriate term. \"\"Statutory rape\"\" is not a very good term to use, because a) it is not used very often in laws themselves, but rather is a more of a pop term b)it technically only refers to intercourse and c)it can include sex with an mature but mentally handicapped adult.

In this article he writes:   \"\"Remember, one of the rules when it comes to technology is Moore's law, that the computing power that can fit on a microchip doubles just under every two years. If this trend holds true, as it has for the past several decades, Australia's Force 2030 will be operating in a world in which our information technology will be a billion times more powerful than today. Notably, this isn't an amorphous \"\"billion\"\", as Dr Evil would pontificate in the movie Austin Powers, but literally taking the power of our current computers multiplying it by 1,000,000,000. But imagine if that law doesn't hold true, and Moore's Law works out at only a hundredth of its past pace. Then the computers that power robots in the era of Force 2030 will only be a mere 1,000,000 times more powerful.\"\"  Ironically, his grasp of numeric quantities is probably even further off than Dr. Evil's.  If \"\"computing power\"\" doubles every two years for twenty years, the resulting increase in computing power would be just 1024 times more powerful (2^10 = 1024 see not \"\"a billion\"\".  And if computing power increased at 1/100th of its current pace (i.e. instead of doubling, increasing at one-one-hundredth of 2 = 0.02 per annum), the resulting increase in power would be just 1.02^10: computers would be 1.21899442 times as powerful as those today.  All this would probably be more relevant if he even managed to get Moore's Law correct in the first place.  Moore's Law did not relate to \"\"computing power\"\" but to the density of transistors in a given area.  In practical terms, a doubling of the number of transistors /= doubling of computing power... so we CERTAINLY aren't going to facing armies of Terminators, a \"\"billion\"\" times more computationally powerful than the robots of today!!!

Apparently he didn't catch her arguing fervently with the suburban dad (discussed at length in the article) on behalf of Obama.  And, perhaps most importantly, he clearly didn’t catch how Susan treated individuals who accused Bush of being Hitler just several years ago.[] Obviously I don’t intend for that video to go up in the article, but I include it to demonstrate that Xeno’s Hitler-related argument is, to be charitable, a laughing matter. By the way, RedPeacock. If you ever want something REALLY entertaining to do, I would suggest going to the Keith Olbermann article and looking at the now-infamous “criticism” section in the talk page. A few conservatives were able to play on the Olbermann-worshipers’ intense devotion to him by getting them to go to such great depths to prevent inclusion into the article that it is not possible to read it without wondering if it’s all just a big joke.

      "\"==GA Review== :This review is transcluded from Talk:Land value tax/GA1. The edit link for this section can be used to add comments to the review.  GA review (see here for criteria)  It is reasonably well written. a (prose):  b (MoS):   Some comments: The lead needs to be considerably longer, at least three times the current length. More at WP:LEAD. The hyphen (-) is for connecting words, while the emdash (—) is used as punctuation. Though the economic effects of land value tax are very important, and definitively require their own section, I am somewhat concerned with it being the first section. I would have preferred to see the first section looking at it from a political/implementational aspect, rather than it as part of a highly abstract framework. As unfortunately is common on many Wikipedia articles on economics, this article uses a too complex language. Economic theory is very abstract, and even myself, with a MSc in the field soon in my pocket, finds it difficult to understand the matters at hand. The use of an unnecessary complex prose makes things even worse. The art of writing an encyclopædia is not to get other economists to undestand the matter at hand, but to explain it to a lay person at high school level. For instance, the phrase \"\"Most taxes distort economic decisions\"\" means abosultely nothing to most people. The next sentence uses a lot of complex words, and introduces many technical terms in the sentance; for instance, i doubt most people know what 'dissuaded', 'correlation', 'levy', 'fallacious' and 'marginal' means. Rememerb, economists can go elsewhere for an academic description of the topic, while our purpose here is to provide information to the masses. I would recommend completely rewriting the section. Do not be concerned if it becomes significantly longer; it is much better that more words are used if they can help explain. In what country is Harrisburg, Pennsylvania? This is not the US Wikipedia, it is the English-language version, and is used by very many people from outside the US, who do not have the slighest idea where neigher Harrisburg nor Pennsylvania is. Always indicate the country, unless evident from context. 'Alegded' should be avoided; if there is disagreement, state the disagreement. Terms like 'deadweight' need to be wikilinked. Even if 'excess burden of taxation' has been linked before, when a synonym is used, it needs wikilinking, since most people associate deadweight with shipping tonnage. 'Surplus' links to a disambiguation page. The history section mixes past and present tense. I find most of the quotes very pereferial to the topic. It would be a lot better just paraphrasing their meaning in the text. Never repeat the name of the article in a section header. I find that there is a blur between the 'implementation' and the 'land value tax systems' sections; they should probably be merged. 'Land value tax' is never to appear all-capitalized (except for the 'l' if at the beginning of a sentence). It is not a proper noun. Of course, the acrony LVT is capitalized. It is factually accurate and verifiable. a (references):  b (citations to reliable sources):  c (OR):    Entire paragraphs are unreferenced. There are  tags. References are references, not quotes. State where the information was found, and if available provide a link. Do not quote the text, even if it is in the public domain. Some of the references are incomplete. All references must have an author (or reliable publisher), and a link to the top of a web site is insufficient. Some sources, such as 'New Jersey Land Value Tax Project', 'Denmark' are not reliable. It is broad in its coverage. a (major aspects):  b (focused):    There are expansion tags on the 'pre-modern' and 'other countries' section. It follows the neutral point of view policy.

      "\"  Regarding the writer at     Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people and also people often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also used the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany.       Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.        The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as \"\"S\"\" shapes standing for its \"\"Socialism\"\" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa\n",

If a pleading fails to specify the allegations in a manner that provides sufficient notice, a defendant can move for a more definite statement under Rule 12(e) before responding. Moreover, claims lacking merit may be dealt with through summary judgment under Rule 56. The liberal notice pleading of Rule 8(a) is the starting point of a simplified pleading system, which was adopted to focus litigation on the merits of a claim.SWIERKIEWICZ V. SOREMA N.&NBSP;A.

      "\":::::: The numbers are indeed possible. First is that the numbers from the 1997 election cannot be used to compare to the current one becuase this was before the point in which the youth would take on a much bigger position than they did today. the conservatives were still around and the youth could not vote then, but now the youth can vote and the conservatives have either died or changed to rather anti-Ahmadinejad. The conservative candidate was nothing like ahmadinejad so he could have had a good 8 million votes. And if you add Rezaee votes with it it comes around 9 million for the consevatives in total. 60% of iran is under 30, and they only know problems under this regime or more specifically, this administration. Besides Ahmadinejad is massively unpopular and the numbers from his previous election are going to decrease because of the increase in sanctions and further isolation from the rest of the world. YOu cannot think that his approval will go up because the nuclear program was started long before ahmadinejad, he just publicized it and his threats against Israel further promoted them, He makes useless provocations against the Holocaust, going as far enough to invite David Duke to tehran to talk about it, and this is not going to promote him very well. Next, most of the programs in Iran were started in the Khatami or even Rafsanjani administration. so the fact the claim that he is supporting the poor is dubious and the Iranians realize this because he has slowed them down or stopped them wholly, in order to pay russia or the military. And he has also placed Gas rationing on one of the largest producers of oil in the world. Point, being Ahmadinejad is not going to be quite popular, even within the conservative corners of the government. Karroubi is popular where ahmadinejad supposedly is so I dont see anything wrong with his votes and the upper class and middle class are going to vote for mousavi. Some of the lower class are going to vote for mousavi since they remember his handeling of the economy in the 80's so that will give him lots of extra votes. Rezaee is still really hated due to his running of the revolutionary guard in the 80's. And do you think that the government was going to tolerate a runoff between two reformists that each got more votes than the conservatives combined. Absolutely not in a million years. So the numbers are reasonable as mentioned above. Next is that you cannot rely on polls in Iran or whatever any government group is going to say. The polls that are \"\"official\"\" are made by the government. you know what I mean. and the groups (the islamic participation front) cannot know the exact extent of their popularity because the people fear evin if the open their mouths.  Second point is that i might have contradicted myself earlier. Any memo that is made by the government is going to have the seal on it, making it offical, period. It does not have any numbers in order to prevent trails as I mentioned Earlier.  Im going to leave this on the page. The first reason is that the letter, wheather fake or not, is being widely circulated around Iran, so it is being used as a catalyst to the protests. The second is that Wikipedia is not a forum in order to determine wheather or not a document is fake or not, If the document is of encyclopedic value, as it is being actively used within the situation as it is in the protests it should be kept. wheather it is fake or not, It is evidence that is being actively used there is vote rigging, (Talk)   \"\n",

      "\"  Image use Hello, concerning the pictures that have been deleted, I'd like to say that I support their inclusion here. They are not in any way sub-standard and for me they enhance the article. I am surprised by the claim that these were not agreed by other editors. Wiki publications encourage collaborative editing and nothing has to be agreed up front in this way.     This image is clearly a photograph of another photograph, or poster, or leaflet.  Not only that, but its a badly framed snapshot, and is obviously the work of an amateur.  The image description is missing, and I do not believe that \"\"own work\"\" is satisfactory for the source field given my concerns about the image. MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.  of Doom  I agree that that's a poor quality image and shouldn't be included in the article.    Parrot, you still need to inform the image author on commons that you have nominated the image for deletion, also it would help the deletion debate if you could give any reasons for your suspicions.     Regarding the other two images (right), the County Hall one seems reasonable enough, but the festival one is badly framed. The lens is too zoomed in for my liking.     The 'Oss picture conveys the feeling of the festival to me, crowded, almost claustrophobic. Would be nice if the editors who originally objectd came here themselves to give their reasons.    Note that there's also an alternative photo of the festival at File:Red obby oss party 20050502.jpg.    Which doesn't include an 'Oss.    No, and I sense that may be important.     I still fail to see what's so terrible about these pictures. By the way, if you're going to remove pictures, please substitute better ones. That way the article is improved, rather than depleted.   Going through them:  The Cornish language one is maybe the worst of the lot, but the reflection on the image is clearly on the \"\"Rooms\"\" banner, not on the photograph. It is difficult to find better images of Cornish language use on Wikimedia. Otherwise we're reduced to road signs which use Cornish place names - and they're really loans into English, rather than proper Cornish language use. Two other options to replace first image are on the right.  There is no way to frame the \"\"Obby Oss\"\". It takes place amongst large crowds of people, often on old streets. Other than that, I can't see what the big deal is here.  The County Hall picture is fine as far as I'm concerned. (However, if you wish a better one, there may well be one on Geograph which can be transferred onto Wikimedia.) It's a non-partisan image, and can't be accused of pandering to any political tendency.  \"\"MacRusgail you'd have a much easier time if you didn't sling insults and accusations around.\"\" - If I wished to insult people, I'd use much stronger language! What I object to is the use of deliberately obscure (and dubious)  abbreviations to justify edits, without a decent explanation as to why. Personally I would have preferred some kind of reasoning. At least that seems to be happening just now.  \"\"obviously the work of an amateur.\"\" - Most of the images on Wikipedia are amateur by definition.

Its even been referred to in article  I'm not saying we should start posting up links to fanart or fanfics (don't care for them), but some things should be made mentioned of.   Shipping  Considering its relationship with both the series and fandom definately needs made mention of. Not \"\"Zomg! Katara and Aang should like totally get together. Kataanger 4ever!\"\" Something like: \"\"One aspect of the series is the 'shipping' which has come to be one of the franchise's main foundations. This is best expressed by the last Comic Con panel, which included a hilarious slide segment dedicated to identifying each and every one, and then some. The most infamous ship is that of the 'Zutara' ship. As the portmanteau  name implies, the ship involves the characters Zuko and Katara, and was first catalyzed by Zuko tying Katara to a try and attempting to bribe her with the necklace of her deceased mother in 'The Waterbending Scroll'. One way or another, it has grown to be one of the most recognizable ship, and also helping it was the fact that the two voice actors shared a parallel relationship on another show, 'American Dragon Jake Long'. Regardless of it origins, due to being known to regularly visits their fansites and forums, the creators are quite aware of the ship or at least seem to enjoy playing with it, as it has been mentioned in almost every interview/convention. Also evident is the fact that the very first commercial clip for the season two finale centered around informing viewers that the two were to be 'spending some unexpectesd time together'\"\"  Now as a person who doesn't ship for any show, as it has a knack for getting in the way of the plot and true characterizations and this show's no different (Sokka's role in Lake Lagoi for example), I'm surprised their isn't even some little line like \"\"For one reason or another, numerous fans have enjoyed pairing blank with blank ever since their interaction in the waterbending scroll in complete disregard of the natural intial unliklihood. Some are thoroughly convinced that the two will 'end up together' \"\" somewhere in their trivia section.    Once again fanart and all that other crap shouldn't be put here but there are some who should be made mentioned of. Kimberly Miranda aka \"\"Isaia\"\", ...aka Aviaq's satirical take on the Avatar fandom has earned her mention in articles and recognition in the eyes of the staff. (she was right on the money with that one) To go even further, recently the deviantart user \"\"rufftoon\"\" known best for lighthearted Avatar based strips, has been enducted as a storyboader for the series. Seriously     Finally in terms of media. Avatar fanvids and online episodes have come to be quite common on youtube, even earning some \"\"most viewed\"\" honors, but are constantly deleted because of copyright issues. Though common for most youtube vids, problems arose with the Google Youtube deal  and have reached a headway. In that tens of thousands of vids were once again removed, and due to Avatar's relations to Viacom, it was affected.  The staff once even expressed their sympathy and support for the production of the videos.  \"\"We did remove the illegal episode broadcasts but the mashups are great. Everybody at Avatar loves them. I have also noticed that some of them have been removed. However it is not by us. Most likely it is the record companies pulling the content because of the music that is used.   Google is cracking down on a lot of this now that they have bought youtube.   We still encourage mashups and videos to the fullest.\"\"   Naturally all this crap doesn't have to go on the main page, could just have a link to its page, like with the media information. Come to think of it, fits well under the “franchise” category. Doesn't even have to all be crammed in one place like this, it just calls for some mentioning here and there, ya'know. Heart of series.

There is also a votes for undeletion page if you want to retrieve something that you think should not have been deleted. If you're still entirely confused, or would like to get a better grasp of your wikipedia skills, and you have an IRC client (or don't mind getting one), check out the Bootcamp. It's not what it sounds like, but it is fun and can help you with your editing skills. If you're bored and want to find something to do, try the Random page button in the sidebar, or check out the Open Task message in the Community Portal.

The first was in Scotland, where a night attack took place on a fort, the second was when the 9th was reformed and marched North into Scotland, never to be seen again. The third involved Boadicea, who was a warlord(ess) way to the South, who seems to have given the 9th (it's THIRD reformation?) another kicking.  Reading more about the first attack, it seems to fit very nicely into your Night Combat article, because it succeeded only because it was carried out at night - an advance unit snuck in the fort, opened the gates, and the hordes rushed in. Classic! They appear to have succeeded because the Romans couldn't even get their armour on in time, let alone form up in any sort of defensive phalanx. Interesting.\n",

      "I am really writing this post to counter the claims that Marxism has direct responsibility for human rights violations, or the regimes it has inspired, (although admittedly at the end of the day Marxism may hold some indirect reponsibility). I think the first person who posted may have a point, however to Telaviv one, although i agree with you that nearly every 'communist' regime has become a tyranny or mobocracy, you also have to realise that nearly every communist regime has not been at all orthodox Marxist. In orthodx marxism (which I dont support) Russia in 1917 would not have been fit to enter communism because it was mainly inhabited by a majority of agriculturalists, it was backwards, and most of its populace was uneducated or illeterate. China qualified even less, as it was totally backwards, and Mao basically disregarded orthodox Marxism, not to even mention cambodia or vietnam. I dont think was perfect, and I am no communist, but I think ideas can be learnt from every notweworthy philosophy, even Marx. You also have to realise Marx's motive for supporting communism was moral/ideological, whereas perhaps with the majority of revolutionary communists the reasons were nationalistic or materialistic, and therefore more associated with the right. What I am saying is that if Marx dictated that communist states should function as they have and do today, yes maybe human rights violations would deserve a mention, but his ideology is not to blame, it is the [people who follow his ideology who often commit the crimes.

      "\"  Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.    Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be \"\"little known\"\" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.    He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.  My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.  Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   \"\n",

Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.  The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.     Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.       Play titles  Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...    Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach  There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.     Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach  Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?     Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach  But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.      Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.     Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach \"\n",

What we need to do is find a way to keep track of all these issues, discuss them (separately or in clusters  whatever works best in various cases), then figure out how to implement what we decide, etc. Now, I really have to get to work now (sometimes I go to work in the middle of the night  quieter, no distractions) but let me quickly suggest the following. Would you mind if, later, I reorder these to bring related issues together, maybe group them into headings, and number them? Then it can be a kind of master checklist while we open separate discussion threads on each issue or cluster, referring to them by number, etc. As new issues come up we can add them under the appropriate heading in the list, and come back to it later if need be. Also, if we get stuck on something (e.g. \"\"Need to get book X at library\"\" or \"\"EEng and CG decided to take a break on this one before they kill each other\"\") we can just note that in the list as the status for that issue, and switch to another issues for a while.

      "\"  Responding to your message: First, I believe that the thing you implied is not true. I don't know of any commonly-accepted policy or guideline that tells people to log in before making wholesale or substantial edits. I think this is a notion of your own that you're using (in good faith) to discourage this editor from contributing.  As I understand, there is for protected and featured articles which the San Francisco article is.  I assume  is a newcomer and not an established user. Someone who's made less than 60 edits fits my concept of a newcomer. Someone who has no welcome message on his or her talk page also fits my concept of a newcomer. (I just went and added a welcome message using .) What you wrote in the edit summary was not in the spirit of welcoming newcomers to the project, which is what the guideline I cited is about.  I think this is your fault as far as jumping to conclusions. The user has made over a 100 edits since February of last year and many to the San Francisco page. Certainly not a \"\"newcomer\"\" under any objective evaluation, and more of a casual editor probably. Not sure why you added the welcome message either when the user probably had one back in 2008, and deleted it.  Furthermore, if this person is going to editing pages for here on out, then this helps my case as well:  You do not need to reveal your offline identity, but having an account gives you a fixed Wikipedia identity that other users will recognize. While we welcome anonymous contributions, logging in under a pseudonym lets you build trust and respect through a history of good edits. It is also easier to communicate and collaborate with an editor if we know who you are (at least, who you are on Wikipedia). It is also easier for veteran users to assume good faith from new users who take the effort to create an account (and you may well become a veteran user yourself some day!). You may well be afforded a great deal less leeway if you do not go to the trouble of making up a username.  This is especially true for a user that edits quite often a featured and/or protected article.  I'm also worried that you're trying to communicate with this user via edit summaries, which are easily missed, even by experienced users with watchlists and all. If the edits he or she is making aren't constructive, you should explain why on the user's talk page, focusing on the nature of edit itself instead of the (to me, unimportant) detail that the person who made it was not logged in.

Well, I believe that your request at WP:RFPP might have been declined due to the fact that the edit war was just starting and there was thus insufficient information of a full scale edit war that would have surely resulted in full protection to the article (by the way, that's how we call it: we don't \"\"block\"\" articles, we \"\"protect\"\" them). If the edit war continues, then do relist your request at WP:RFPP. It will likely to be accepted. I also have to agree that you might have failed to control yourself sometimes, when in the face of your opponent Tocino. Edit warring is never a good choice, as it only worsens a dispute and can indeed grant blocks to both of you (although I think that a topic ban would be quite an unlikely/draconian measure, you're not causing that much trouble as far as I see). My suggestion is, when Tocino (or any other user) makes an edit that you strongly disagree with, refrain from reverting right away and instead, summon the other party to the talk page. Then two things may happen: either he joins the discussion so you can both argue your points of view, or he doesn't join the discussion and provides you with a good reason for requesting an administrator's intervention against his unilateral actions. I hope this helps. Best regards, nd \"\n",

      "\", 22 July 2011 (UTC) I have requested the move based on Wikipedia policy and not google results which I have already indicated I lend no special weight to. But now I'll give you an example of why you shouldn't lend weight to them either, I  will also tell you why the results you have aren't at all reliable. Using the search term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" does not tell us the context of the result google finds. I'll give you an excellent example of this: I googled \"\"female genital cutting\"\" from 2010 to 2010, (link here:[]). I draw your attention to the 3rd result from the top (that is, the 3rd most relevant result that google could find across that entire year for that term), the title of this article is \"\"Sexual function in women with female genital mutilation\"\". Given that the title of this article clearly favours the term FGM, I opened the pdf that google links to in order to find how exactly the term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" was used in the article. This is the text I found on page 2 of that article:  \"\"Worldwide, it is estimated that 100 to 140 million girls and women have undergone some form of FGM, and each year 2 million girls are thought to be at risk (1). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification is superior to terms used by the public or even some scholarly reviewed publications. The latter terms include female genital cutting, female circumcision, female Sunna circumcision, and Pharaonic circumcision.\"\" If the 3rd result on the first page of google scholar search is already a result which is refuting the use of the term FGC, then I submit to you that you can't rely on google scholar results (or ratios of results) as a method of determining whether FGC is replacing or augmenting the term FGM. Also note that the 4th result also uses FGM in the title, and that the 6th result is another which is refuting the use of the term. If stats are what matter, then I'll put that into numbers. 33% of the top results for the term \"\"female genital cutting\"\" for the year 2010 are refuting the use of the term female genital cutting.   20:52\"\n",

Just because some one writes books and they are used as sources in articles is not a good way to determine primary use.  I'd argue that the 59 references used to write the Mary Miller (actress) implies a much more notable person and better makes the case then another article that is based on only a single reference.  I think that adding Mary Millar in the list of statistics confuses many since it is just a similar spelling and that would be better handled as a See also on the dab page.  Obviously this means that the current page needs to be disambiguated to Mary Miller (art historian) to allow the dab page to be moved.  Using the statistics provided in opposition to this proposal clearly shows that, if anything, the current article does not even receive a majority of the hits.  So while that is not a good way of proving primary use, in this case it makes a strong case that there is no obvious primary use so the dab page should be moved. Looking at the numbers in a less biased way you see:  Mary Miller (disambiguation) 0 (newly created)  Mary Miller (actress) 275  Mary Miller 679  Mary Millicent Miller 567 (newly created)  Mary Miller Glasscock 32 (newly created)\n",

Changing the wording so that one out of five is different, in order to fit the link, doesn't work, in terms of expression.     Also, the insertion of the word \"\"Anglican\"\" in the names of the churches is superfluous in the context of the article, as Blacket was working for the Church of England at the time. The insertion of \"\"Anglican\"\" into churches' names is a recent thing, and generally considered unnecessary, elswhere. While links may require the word, the context of the sentence (and most of the article) doesn't, so it's better to link as St Michael's, Surry Hills, until linking in the list below, where the full names of all the churches can be given.   \"\n",

Wikistalking has to involve some sort of harassment.  Placing citation requests on POV statements (that could be deleted just because they are unsourced} and making other positive edits is not harassment.  I was even more surprised to see an administrator remove a copyvio template when there is obvious copyright violation (Skeptic's Dictionary).  I didn't say anything about that, either.  Indeed, I have been very patient in the face of inappropriate behaviour on the part of Askolnick and KarlBunker, including inappropriate comments and ganging up together to evade the 3RR rule to prevent articles from being edited.  It is patently unfair for Askolnick and KarlBunker to be allowed to violate Wikpedia policy at will.

I've been around many Hasidim for a long, long time too, and I have never heard of Sakmer either, so it may just be baloney and that word should be removed.   there is a street in KJ called Sakmer  also: look at this  The reason some call it Sakmer is because the name Satmer is based on Satu Mare which remotely referes Saint Mary [NOTE - not true, Satu Mare means simply \"\"Large Village\"\" in Romanian!]. Hassidic Jews have always refrained from sanctifying Christian saints and therefore have created alternative names for quite a few cities. Izak love, when you don't know something, that does not make it balony.   PS, I haven't been \"\"studying\"\" Satmer - I am one, and my maternal grandfather referes to his birthplace as Sakmer (AKA Satu Mare). PPS There is no KJ street called Sakmer. The photo you attached clearly dubbs the Satmar Rabbi \"\"The Rav of Sakmer\"\". For those who study Satmer but have no knowledge of the script which the Satmers use, the word is the one at the lower left corner looking something like this: סאקמער. The third letter from the right carries the K sound. Cheers.  I recently heard in regular chatting from an acquaintence that an ancestor (great-grandfather?) of his called Satmar Sakmer. Why do they not utilize that term anymore? And, I'm done with my hardcore pshat study of different Hasidic groups.    It's total nonsense, the 'saint mary' story. Satu Mare means 'large town'. My father has been there many times. Wikipedia (yes yes) also says that Satu Mare means 'large town', and that 'saint mary' is something else entirely in Hungarian/Romanian.   I revised the opening paragraph by indicating the Satmars are one of the largest hasidic groups - it is widely thought there are about 200,000 Lubavitchers, but since none of the hasidic groups keeps a formal membership role, this is all conjecture - it would be incorrect for any group to claim they are the largest, there is no way of knowing.   About Satmar and NETUREI KARTA. THe Cherem bit is incorrect, as is the bit of a denunciation. Also the part of asking Reb Yoilish to meet with Yasser Arrafat. It's all myth. Yasser Arafat and the PLO were not the public face of the Palestinian cause before Reb Yoilish had his stroke, so it doesn't make sense. I actually asked a chaver of the Satmar Beis Din about the Cherem, and he said it's nonsense. The Beis DIn has not publicly issued a cherem against a person or group of people since its formation in the United States. No denunciation was issued either. It's a made up propaganda piece by the Kakhnik radio station Arutz Sheva. It never happened. No such thing ever appeared in Der Yid, which is the official newspaper.

See Harvard's treatment in other Wikipedias with regard to \"\"prestige\"\" and Boosterism in Lead, two and three sections above, respectively.    I agree that we should be vigilant to ensure that college and university articles don't unduly praise their subjects, particularly since it can quickly get out of hand and become meaningless.  But there really are a handful of institutions for whom their prestige is so well-known and widespread that it has become one of their defining characteristics.  Harvard University is one of those institutions.  It's essential for readers to understand that Harvard University is one of the most prestigious universities in the world.  That's what so many people know about it and why its alumni are disproportionately represented among the political and economic elite.  Indeed, it's why so many colleges, universities, and other institutions proclaim themselves to be the \"\"Harvard of the (region, category, etc.).\"\" And please note that we are not claiming that Harvard is'' the most prestigious, the best, or anything else.  We are merely documenting the widespread and essential-to-know perception shared by many people.     Agreed completely, and ElKevbo, you are right in claiming that we are not claiming that Harvard isn't the most prestigious as that sounds a bit to peacocky for my own taste, and probably even yours. I think Megapixel will need to understand this. I've noted that ever since I placed some controversial, if peacocky text to the main header about \"\"Big Three\"\", he/she has been repeatedly disagreeing with whatever comes in the headers about the Harvard, Yale, Princeton articles.    ''''''  What did I do this time?  Some one has changed it back, once again this editor crows to the world, I suggest the accolades are reserved for the US rather than 'the world' or better yet remove it altogether, it is unseemly.    I suggest that if you don't know that Harvard is considered one of the world's most prestigious universities then you're incompetent to edit this article.  But to placate you I added two more references that explicitly and directly support the assertion.  Can we move on now or should we continue this pointless discussion?     Let's end this discussion. Done. If there's more and more reversions on this, we risk getting this article fully protected and admins to only edit it.   ''''''  What did I do this time?   Appreciate the comments on this topic. To Abhijay's point above, I am vigilant of disproportionate attributes featured in the header. Please see the Yale talk thread to see how someone tried putting in a \"\"Big Three\"\" comment in the top header that couldn't be referenced in the last 10 years outside of football. The two additional sources that were added are great and appreciated, but this gets to another point in that those articles reference several schools as the 'most prestigious'. Should those other schools (top 10? top 5?) also get a similarly cited blurb that proclaims them as among the most prestigious in their header. I think that's the fair treatment question that should be raised to ensure consistency. No other school has a similar grandiose opening as Harvard when numerous surveys have shown that there are a select few other Universities that hold comparable prestige.  (\n",

First time reading through, I thought that she might have been playing a pleasure girl again, on the space station.  “friend of one of the crew” can be confusing, considering the staff of a starship are a crew.

To quote the Wikipedia article on shepherds, \"\"A shepherd is one who takes care of sheep, usually in flocks in the fields... Unlike farmers, shepherds were often wage earners, being paid to watch the sheep of others.\"\" The 1960s weren't Biblical times. Shepherding had long since become one of those crappy jobs that down-and-out laborers got when they could get it. In fact, that's an important part of Proulx's story, characterizing them as a particular kind of wretched of the earth. Calling them cowboys is yet another example of arrogant coastal ignorance.  I am more sensitive to the argument that they only worked on the sheep operation that one summer. Afterwards Ennis worked with cattle and Jack worked most of his life in an office job (not as a \"\"rodeo cowboy\"\" to whoever made that remark). However, the bulk of the movie painstakingly details that crucial first summer, the summer that so defined them. Therefore, I'd say that the relevant description, especially in this paragraph discussing THAT SUMMER, would be shepherds. That, however, is more up for debate. I would settle for calling them laborers who got jobs herding sheep. Although anybody who's ever worked on a ranch or knows a damn thing about ranching knows that that's just a circumlocution for shepherd. But since I don't want to make a personal hobby of constantly changing this page, I'll settle for that as a compromise. Chris   \"\n",

I think the same article can be used for both the 1955 and 1962 calendars, adding the rank of feasts (Double/III Class), and some sort of special formatting or asterisks for Feasts which are only on one or the other.   Re-reading the first comment, I'm also starting to like the idea.

      "\"  When I saw the edits and MPLX's addition yesterday, I found it rather anti-GWB (which I happen to share, but...) POV and unfounded. The connection seems absurdly weak and tenuous; for decades if not centuries politicians all the world over have been speaking of peace while waging or preparing war, and assuring the populace that it is a just war to bring a better tomorrow for everybody (in my country, we have rich experience with \"\"fighting for peace\"\"). So, first of all, I don't think the speech was particularly paradoxical, let alone \"\"[[Orwellian]\"\" - although I don't follow the US media; if MLPX can provide links of other commentators noting this, he has a case in point. Secondly, even if the speech was meant to explicitly refer to FDR's Four Freedoms, I think that the mediated connection to 1984 is too loose and willed for an encyclopedia. Thirdly and most importantly, even if the section had a place in the article, it's certainly not squat in the middle of the section \"\"The World of 1984\"\". Move it down among late references, if it must be kept (and I agree with Alavery7 that it concerns more the speech than the novel so it should be better moved there).   12:17, 25 Jan 2005 (UTC)\"\n",

      "\" January 2010 (UTC)  Thank you, Dave, and thank you for your welcome on “My Talk”.  “This section was started with discussion of \"\"bias in favor of Darwin's theory\"\" raising the issue of misrepresentation of Darwin by anti-evolutionists, and as discussed above, we have to give due weight to the overwhelming scientific majority view on the basic subject of evolution.”  I certainly agree with that.   But on the issue of using “realised”, I just have a couple of things to say. But as a preamble, if you like, I want to make the distinction between a theory and the reality that scientists etc test it against (I’m not being insulting, I assume everyone knows this already, but I’m making a case). Scientists don’t “prove” theories are true. But by conducting experiments they falsify the “bad” theories (again I assume you know this and obviously this is in agreement with the philosophy of Karl Popper).  Now,  I think it’s bad practice to state things in such a way that a theory sounds like it’s the “truth” (meaning in perfect agreement with reality) because it destroys this distinction (between theory, or scientific fact, and reality or truth. To say that “X realised that Y”, where Y is a theory, is suggesting that Y is “in perfect agreement with reality”. Now, I think the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” does correspond perfectly with reality, but I also think we need to remember that it is still a theory (nothing is proven, remember, according to Popper) consistent with the general scientific method and perspective I already briefly outlined. Of course, in the case of evolution, someone arguing like this sounds rather silly  - it sounds like you’re being pedantic bordering on obsessive. Of course not all theories are the same - Popper would argue that theories that have “survived” criticism and rigorous testing are more “corroborated” (but never fully verified). But even if you wanted to make some exceptions, like the statement “all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors”, for the sake of scientific consistency, I think we should refrain from using “realised” in this context (incidentally, in regards to making exceptions, I certainly wouldn’t make any exceptions in respect to the sources given by David Wilson - these seem to me to be much more egregious cases of the word “realised”).  Anyway, so much for theory. As far as concrete help is concerned, have you thought about deleting “who realised that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors” altogether?  You probably know more about the history of evolution than I do, but I thought that this idea didn’t actually come from Darwin (I could be wrong, of course). But if it does, what about “Charles Robert Darwin FRS (12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist who first proposed the fact that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors, and also the scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection” or some variation on this?

      "\"  BritishWatcher: Thanks for your courteous and transparent question (the first I have seen from the UK clique since I got \"\"involved\"\").  I'll address your second point.  If my answer to that is not clear, there is little point taking the time to suggest actual changes.  Your clarifying question mentions the premise that each part of the UK has its own subdivisions.  The article states this, but your phrasing implies that the parts are not themselves subdivisions.  The article says nothing about that.  Besides the lack of clarity on that point (assuming your reading is correct), there is another confusion in the article: I think the majority of the people reading this article will understand that the four countries are the focus of the article and that the title of the article (Subdivisions...) refers to them.  If it is the case that the parts are not themselves subdivisions, then the article is far from clear on this point (except to the three or four who have been \"\"involved\"\").  Hence, there are two confusions in the article: 1) the title suggests that the parts are subdivisions (because of the structure and general content of the article) and 2) since the article explicitly divides the UK into the four countries, this suggests that the parts are themselves subdivisions.  Your reading suggests that the title of the article should be \"\"subdivisions of the four parts of UK\"\", not \"\"subdivisions of the UK\"\".  Until these confusions are addresses, I think the article casts more shadow than light on the subject.   \"\n",

      "The new picture cinches itGood work   The new picture of Lee Harvey Oswald holding a rifle and other incriminating evidence is much better than the similar one that was in the article.  See, Exhibit 746-A from the Warren Commission.  The new picture is much darker and conceals the apparent  fabrication of the photo as complained about by Oswald before he was shot.   We have to keep in mind that the fabrication of photographs back in 1963 was still rather primitive.  The similar pictures that the Warren Commission had available are either blow ups of the picture (which are too revealing or have disastrous results), or the print is not dark enough to conceal the cut and paste job on the face of which Oswald  complained.  See, for example Warren Commission Ex 746-C with the face pasted on at the level of the chin.   It was also a wise choice not to use Exhibit 749 because it has that embarrassing oversight where someone drew in what appeared to be the butt of the gun stock for another photograph and re-used it with the triangular piece of gun stock still drawn in. (See, third picket from Oswald's leg).  It actually might be better just to describe the pictures and not reproduce. If the reader looks at one picture the reader might look at the rest.\n",

      "\"   Introductions and order   The exchange below began between user:Terryeo and user:BTfromLA on personal talk pages.  With Terreyo's permision, I have pasted the discussion here, as I think it is relevant to the editing of the page, and may be of interest to other editors.    Specifically about NPOV as it manifests in the Dianetics article.  Untill a subject is introduced it can not be argued.  The latest and greatest \"\"One more try\"\" intertwines two points of view, I'll grant that.  But don't you see all the discussion on the page from everyone who has done some Dianetics saying, \"\"This article makes no sense, it isn't something that can be followed even by a person knowledgeable in Dianetics\"\"  Don't you see that happening?  The problem is real, real simple.  You seem to be creating an article that says, \"\"Dianetics is a controversial subject ! ! !\"\"   Well, that is all right, as far as it goes.  But it does not make clear what Dianetics is, do you see the problem?  I believe the reason why is simply that Dianetics is never allowed to be introduced because you have to make the article have controversy in every damn line of it !    No, Terryeo, I don't think controversy and criticism belong in every line, and I think if you look closely at what I've written, you'll see that isn't the case.  I know you wish it were otherwise, but the social consensus about Dianetics is at odds with the way Hubbard and Scientologists view it.  Readers should be informed of this from the outsetit is the social context in which Dianetics exists. That doesn't mean that Hubbard's ideas can't be fairly represented, and I think they should be.     I did look closely at what you wrote, the very first line of it had a lie in it, an unverifiable statement.  I am very glad you used the word \"\"context\"\" because that is exactly my point.  If you will look at this wiki link about introductions it tells you where \"\"context\"\" should appear in an introduction and it is an important thing to know.  However, it is not to appear in the first line of an introduction.  I am simply following wiki policy here and please get off the \"\"I know you think it should be otherwise\"\" because i am going to continue to insist on wiki policy being followed.  Here is the link which tells when in an introduction, context should be stated:  Wikipedia:Introductions  First the term is introduced.  In the case of Dianetics  the introduction of the term should probably include its origins because it is a word created from Greek roots unfamilar to many people.  Then, after the term itself is introduced the topic needs be introduced.  This is the policy, read it right there.  Then, after the topic is introduced (so readers can know what is being talked about) then, at that point context.  It is not that you are doing things wrong, but slightly out of sequence for a reader to be able to understand, okay? Happy New Year !    Terryeo, I'd suggest that this sort of discussion take place on the article's talk page in the future, since it is likley to be seen as relevant by other editors.  As to the policy about introductions, I find it hard to believe you mean this seriously. The guideline says that the introduction \"\"defines the term and topic and context\"\": it says nothing about the order in which those things are presented. And introducing a term rarely involves spelling out the etymology of the term. Again, it doesn't all need to happen in the short intro.  Look at line #2 of that intro guideline.     BTfromLA, what part of \"\"term, topic, context is unclear to you?  Term, this means the word itself.  Topic, this means the topic itself.  The Wiki Policy makes this clear, it spells it out A, B, C.  What is your argument?  It does not say, \"\"Context and controversy first! and then, when people understand the whole subject is nothing but a controversy and should be left alone and never understood, then introduces the definition of the term. No, it does not say, Stuff these things in the intro any way you want to.  It says, Term.  Topic. Context.  A and then B and then C.  okay?  It says everything about the order of presentation.  First is says Term. How simple can it be, you got to tell your student the meaning of the word you use.  Then it says topic.  How simple can it be, you have to tell the student what you are going to be talking about.  Then, after that, after people know what the topic is, then, then is the time for context. okay?

      "\"==My complaint about the WMF== When assessing WMF's policies, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. Let's start with my claim that WMF insists that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft. Sorry, WMF, but, with apologies to Gershwin, \"\"it ain't necessarily so.\"\" Gloomy philodoxes like WMF are not born—they are excreted. However unsavory that metaphor may be, if WMF's patsies had even an ounce of integrity they would urge lawmakers to pass a nonbinding resolution affirming that a real fight against vagarious, gin-swilling Comstockism can be undertaken only if a basic change in social conditions makes it possible to set the stage so that my next letter will begin from a new and much higher level of influence.  Forgive me for boring you with all the gory details, but I must ask that WMF's torchbearers change the world for the better. I know they'll never do that so here's an alternate proposal: They should, at the very least, back off and quit trying to parlay personal and political conspiracy theories into a multimillion-dollar financial empire. All the deals WMF makes are strictly one-way. WMF gets all the rights, and the other party gets all the obligations. WMF's belief is that it should be free to identify political and religious groups that are its political enemies and re-label them as \"\"improvident, rambunctious know-nothings\"\" in order to justify operations against them. Hey, WMF! Satan just called; he wants his worldview back.  I've tried to explain to WMF's snarky pals that WMF is incapable of looking with an open mind at anything that doesn't strictly endorse its views. As could be expected, they were a bit slow on the uptake. I just couldn't get them to comprehend that I can say one thing about WMF. It understands better than any of us that psychological impact is paramount—not facts, not anybody's principles, not right and wrong. I'm not suggesting that we behave likewise. I'm suggesting only that WMF is unquestionably proud of itself for conconcting such a \"\"brilliant\"\" scheme for harming others or even instilling the fear of harm. In my opinion, however, that's the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. Much better would be to give the needy a helping hand as opposed to an elbow in the face. That's the end of this letter. If I was unable to convince you that I am making an appeal to the intelligence of the reader not to be fooled by WMF's demagoguery, then you should definitely consider contacting me with your supporting or refuting evidence, opinions, personal stories, etc., so that I can make a better argument in my next letter.    micro.dot.cotton \"\n",

Like everybody else, admins are expected to behave in a civil manner.  Admins should also be aware that warning a user of a block, especially when the user has no prior history of problems, can be perceived as a threat. When dealing with otherwise good contributors, it may be advisable to make suggestions to their behavior without mentioning a block.  Reflecting on those words... I don't believe some of your intial words to me (which included ad hominem attacks me and threats to block me remotely match those standards).  \"\"Every sane person with normal adult intelligence can see that your allegations against B.F. are nonsensical. If you can't see that yourself, it's probably no use me trying to explain it to you. I will simply block you if you continue with this topic, for being either a malicious troll or too clueless for rational discussion\"\"  Also... I don't believe it was appropriate after I had made the initial anon complaint about you for you to block me (if you felt it was necessary it should have been left in the hands of another admin). The Wikipedia admin code of conduct clearly states this about admin conflicts of interests.  \"\"An admin should not block a user if they are not neutral with respect to that user, or have a conflict of interest\"\"  The reason why I'm asking is because I realize we both have strong POV on FYROM issues and that we got off on the wrong foot because of it. While I am preparing to push forward with a precisely itemized complaint against you (which I believe clearly shows inappropriate behavior towards me) I really don't want to go about this the long nasty way (which was why as a newb my complaint was anon until Beam started to unilaterally campaign to block me and reveal details)   I would much prefer to save both our time by letting the matter drop but that would require your participation and assurance you will never again try to leverage your admin status as a tool to personally threaten me again.

The images within the text are all relevant to specific items in the text, located together as close as the system allows and thus are in compliance. 4.

I found that the Cezanne Gallery had a similar number, Renoir had several more, and Monet had twice as many; therefore again by comparison of numbers are in compliance.   NOTE: Relating to the Gallery, Diego was highly accomplished in several genres.  I culled from hundreds of image choices to illustrate Diego’s versatility identified by Genre: Works, Faces, Surrealism, Cubism, Clowns/Harlequins/Musicians, Landscapes, and Horses/Boats.  I wanted to add Fauvism, Figures and Abstract but, decided to err on the conservative side for total numbers of images.   5.      Lastly, to show my good faith to the conscientious editor, I eliminating 5 images from the body of the text.  Removed is one of the 2 Native Indian images.  And somewhat reluctantly, 4 images of official government documents which I felt added credibility.  They will now be found scanned documents.   In closing, compliance with Wikipedia has been and IS my objective for the Antonio Diego Voci page.  Maintaining the highest integrity, accuracy and visual appeal is vital to both Wikipedia and the reputation of Antonio Diego Voci.   Thanks, User:Ahjkl67435\n",

      "\"   Referencing   Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=|author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=|title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.  In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says \"\"Cite.\"\" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.  My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon.   Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.  I'm certain you'll have more questions, please feel free to ask.

My actions are strictly within Wikipedia policies, don't try to throw a book at me, you'll catch it back.

Every day I come to contribute to this admittedly well-intentioned website, there's some new template, some new project, some new policy (usually arcane and for the benefit of the person who quotes it), some new shortcut, some funkified userbar or some such. It's gone beyond a joke. The KISS principle pass you guys by, did it? You do know what you're succeeding at with all these shortcuts, templates and cross-references, don't you? You're turning people off from contributing by purposeful obfuscation.

TAB    Until you came along, discussing the Jack Vance article was precisely what we were doing here. Hadn't you noticed?   TAB    Peter, I couldn't agree with you more.

      "\"  Update re: \"\"public domain\"\" in the United States Some parting comments re: the two images; for those still seeking to document the licenses that reference \"\"public domain\"\" in Poland and/or in the United States, one might want to take a look at the \"\"Photo credits\"\" in the PBS (U.S. public television) documentary Website for its series Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State (2005); about a week ago I edited the article on the BBC program to include the source citations for the PBS broadcast of the same program (with diff. title). (cont.) Today, while searching \"\"images of Auschwitz prisoners public domain\"\" out of residual curiosity re: this matter, I located one photo credit referring to \"\"public domain\"\" in the U.S.-published Website for the BBC program shown on PBS: it is a photo credit for \"\"Auschwitz prisoners\"\" (not Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum/Wilhelm Brasse photographs, but photographs taken contemporaneously at Auschwitz in period from 1940 to 1945, depicting prisoners outside on the grounds of the camp at a barbed wire fence, e.g.: see Credits, scroll down to \"\"Auschwitz prisoners\"\", and go to page 1 (hyperlinked) to see the photographs.  If PBS is citing \"\"public domain\"\" in the United States, this might be a helpful precedent to cite re: Auschwitz photographs (taken by Polish photographers w/o copyright credits being given?).  Just a thought. (cont.) I do not expect to be editing Wikipedia much if at all in the near future, so I thought I'd leave others with this possible publication precedent in the U.S. for citing U.S. (and possiblly worldwide) \"\"public domain\"\" re: photographs of Auschwitz prisoners; though I am not sure it applies in the UK or European Union too; that would not matter if it applies in the U.S. (cont.) The so-called duplicate photograph (3 poses) of Kwoka in the Wik. Commons file of same name is not exactly the same; it would be a good idea to rename the Wikipedia version as asked in the template to reduce possibility of deletion; the one in Wik. Commons still has the Museum captions in it and by virtue of that is possibly not in the public domain.  The cropped one w/o the Museum captions has a stronger argument for \"\"public domain\"\" in the U.S.  (The one that is more clearly a photograph of the Museum-captioned photograph has a weaker argument as such, though I am not sure of that.  See the various discussions of the two images linked via the templates.) It is important to correct the conflict/problem pointed out via the templates of the duplicate names for images that have conflicting licenses/fair use rationales in Wik. and Wik. Commons.  If the images are determined by the reviews to be public domain in the U.S., they do not need fair-use rationales; they can be files in Wikipedia Commons (w/o Museum captions/the cropped version currently in this article) and not duplications w/ same name in Wikipedia (??).   \"\n",
