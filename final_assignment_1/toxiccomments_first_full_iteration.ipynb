This article has defiantly shown an improvement and is closer to scientifically accurate after my posts.

      "When I first started looking into this topic, the articles I found were woefully inaccurate and defiantly biased.  I still feel that objectively, the definition should clearly state that most cross-breeds lead to a reduction in fitness.  Heterosis can be induced through breeding stragity such as line-breeding but it is a wasteful effort.  Random mixing of genes is similar to random mutation, most of which is deadly and not beneficial to the gene pool.  99% of mutations are deleterious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Respect of natural selection should be the default position.  There are quantifiable difference between the races which were developed over hundreds of generations and whatever diversity we have managed to achieve should be cherished, what makes us different is what makes us special.  By mixing the races, in one or two generations we can undo the work of hundreds or thousands of years of evolution.\n",

Looking back, my terseness associated with the urgency I felt doesn't exactly make me seem that altruistic. I'm over it, and (indirectly) getting a rationale for my block has satisfied my concern.

I try hard to assume good faith, and I certainly would like to have the same assumed of my actions.  Having contributed a number of userboxes, and finding them deleted without notice, I was confused.  Upon digging deeper, I saw that the problem was much more serious that a few templates being deleted out of process.  There are a number of admins that seem to think that they have the right to dictate to the masses what is and is not acceptable content in the user space.  This is wrong.  User space is where wikipedians are allowed to express their POV, personal convictions, and interests.  Admins do have a responsibility to wikipedia, but first and foremost it should be recognized that wikipedia only exists because of wikipedians.  Actions such as mass purges, mass deletions, and mass edits without explanation, are basically the most disruptive possible avenue available.  In the grand scheme of things, userboxes are basically unimportant, but they have become the most critical issue on the wikipedia at present because they have been attacked by administrators without comment or explanation, outside of process, and with no regard for the impact this has on the community.  I am unhappy with your part in this, Tony, and I expected better.  I feel that admins should learn from their mistakes, and the mistakes of others, but I am afraid I see these being repeated.  If you feel you have the right, then you are welcome to exercise it - but you will destroy the wikipedia if you destroy the desire of wikipedians to participate.

The rumours about her not being able to handle the rough weather are true, which is why she was only in service during the high-peak months of July-August.  She indeed did have a lot of mechanical problems-mostly eletrical and hydraulic related, but yes her engines(Pielstick's) were also fussy and burned an obscene amount of fuel.  Ontario Northland, who were/are the former owners, took a huge financial loss as they paid $13 million for the vessel, while she was only in service for four seasons, from 1989-1992.  In contrast, the Chi-Cheemaun has been in service for 32 years now.

I only mean this rhetorically. The fact is, the payment period and the compounding period do not need to coincide at all; the compounding period is a convention. I hope I express this properly, and I do not do this on a day to day basis, but my understanding is:\n",
      " The compounding per se is on a six month basis, but can be calculated at any time.\n",
      " So, if you are late three days (and no grace period, etc), the amount payable is added to principal for this period of time. If you ask the bank (and their systems are up to date), you can determine new principal, which is old principal plus payment amount plus accumulated interest to that day.\n",
      " If you pay on the third day, you will have interest payable on the original principal plus the delayed payment for three days at the six-month compound rate (expressed as a fraction of days / six months).\n",
      " In fact, this is basically identical to interest on a given sum for x% annual interest for y days. You would pay interest of principal times x% times y/365. It just doesn't get compounded for the interim days (for example, on a daily basis).\n",
      " Why six months, etc? I have no idea. That was the convention a long time ago and it has stuck, and I think at one point \"\"they\"\" chose to require banks etc to all quote and calculate on the same basis, rather like an APR.\n",

I suspect that 'ponde' is cheyanne or sioux as talking to those people its their word, but Sturt may very well have made that name up and I suspect he did.  Some Sioux etc were very much in the Gundagai area but Sturt may have known the word before he went downriver.  It seems he left a ponde downriver also.  Another aussie word that is native american is 'creek'.  We do not blink at its use, ever. Sturt did record the pondebadgery word.  What pondebadgery refers to is appropriate and is in context and association, just the vowles etc do not sound to me that ponde is a Wiradjuri word.  NOTE:  I did not note that it was a wiradjuri word. I only note Wiradjuri words if they have a known ethnology.  Sturt records Warby being at Pondebadgery.  This is the g.g.granddad of Ben Warby who holds the world water speed record.  Warby does not record 'pondebadgery' nor does anyone else in all of Australia's story that I am aware of and I have looked extensively. Just Sturt does though badgery or budgeri is previously recorded.  \"\"Charles Sturt's Pondebadgery\"\" is more correct than what it has been edited to as that edit seperates Sturt from the word when no one knows that at all so its factually incorrect and should not be done as its making something that was correct as it stood, into fiction.  The cod story is very correct.  I can't vouch for the use of 'ponde' in it as being of Indigneous origin, though.\"\n",

Even St. Paul himself resisted St. Peter, our first Pope, \"\"to the face\"\" when His Holiness did an unwise thing (Galatians 2), and St. Catherine of Siena used to write letters to the Pope, basically telling him to act like a man LOL Our differences pretty much come down to different understandings of infallibility, to perceptions of our ability to criticize and resist prudential, pastoral decisions, and to our different notions of Christian obedience (and here different trads have different opinions as to what should be obeyed or rightfully resisted, because that is a prudential concern in itself, one that each Catholic has to study and pray about).\n",

Again, there remain very few facts that we can associate with GG overall short of what's in the current History section - it is a war of opinions here, that's why its a controversy.  Further FRINGE states we give fringe views a neutral, fair treatment with the associated weight of ink they get from RS. So because ethics claims have been discussed, if not then debunked by the authors in the next breath, in these highly reliable sources, we can discuss them in a non-prejudging way and then later include the criticism of them; that's how we meet all content policies. End of the day we cannot appear to take a side in the GG issue, and everything you have said above is against that point. And that I'm \"\"trying to use an avalanche of incredibly negative stories\"\" to say its about ethics is 100% wrong. I'm trying to introduce the required impartiality into the article per NPOV. I don't necessarily believe at the end of the day GG is about ethics, but they have presented that as their case, and as we are an impartial encyclopedia, we should include any facets of their case that have been appropriately documented in highly reliable sources. Failure to do so is showing a partial view of the story. The fact that these claims are made in negatively-charged stories doesn't matter, they are stated in what everyone here is considering as highly reliable sources; most of what we know about Westboro Baptist Church, for example, comes from highly-negative sources about the congretation, but we still can document what the church claims about itself from them.

I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of \"\"vandalism\"\" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw \"\"vandalism\"\" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a \"\"disarming\"\" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.\n",

      "\n",
      "I would like to know when the Barelvis became a minority in Pakistan. It is the largest sect in Pakistan. Even the outdated CIA fact book can verify this. It seems that alJazera does not know what they are talking about. If anyone have a doubt about the connection between Barelvis and sufis, then simply read an article about Barelvis(which is insufficient and at parts incorrect - like many other articles here). They are sufis or they have a sufi master to whom they belong(speaking on the individual level). Personally I can tell you that for a Barelvi, sufis are considered our elderly; our wise sages who we seek for enlightenment and religious knowledge. Barelvi == Sufi more or less(to simplify things for the reader). People need to stop selling their propaganda and belittling the sufis. Barelvis usually call themselves ahle sunnah wal'jamat(this would be the international representative name barelvis refer themselves as - unlike in Pakistan and India due to complexities arising due to impostors). This is the largest sect in the Islamic world(no quotation - simply based on experience and personal research); where sufis are considered as mentioned, our elderly, our sages, our spiritual guides. Hence sufi's are not some sect, but simply our respectable elderly. The sect is called Ahle Sunnah wal'Jamat. An ok translation would be \"\"The people of the Sunnah\"\". Unlike Christianity, the right to claim of the true sect is of utmost importance for muslims due to Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w mentioning of the divide among us and that only one sect would be the truly guided one - which shall happen to be the largest one(from the hadith). Again seek out the source if you are interested. Its in the major Hadith collections. Hence quantity is an important question when it comes to pinpointing any discrepancy in this regard. Strictly speaking from an encyclopedic perspective, how can it be considered acceptable to disregard quantity ? If anyone doubts that most Pakistanis are sufis/barelvis/ahle sunnat wal'jamat. Then simply take a look at Sindh. I don't have the exact number, but its like 90-95 % sufis. Its only in NWFP that the majority are Wahabis. But that corresponds to ca. less than 10%(there are shia as well in NWFP and some other sects) of the total population in Pakistan(census 2010). How difficult is it for people to at least conduct their own research and try to separate truth from fallacy ?\"\n",

      " Ward Churchill is Not An Indian \n",
      "I am an enrolled member of Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and I used to work for the BIA. I added into the article the written opinions of people that have researched Churchill's Indian ancestry and 99% of these Indian folks point out that Churchill has not provided the basic information required to prove that he is an Indian. I put it up last night and it much of it was taken down early this morning. It was information where I provided sources for the comments. I understand that what I wrote can and should be edited. But taking out information that provides sources and citations seems to be an attempt to stifle the information. Dear Fred Bauder, it IS fair to ask if Churchill really is an Indian. He is taking away from actual Indian people the ability to speak for themselves. He has build his whole career on being someone who has experienced the oppression of a minority culture. It is similar to a white middle class Protestant person from Idaho was writing books about himself being a Jew in Hitler's Germany. And don't even say that I just made a inaccurate analogy because Churchill himself compares and uses Hitler and Nazi analogies. I'm sure that is how you learned about him in the first place because he made this most recent comment about 9/11 victims are all \"\"Eichmann's.\"\" Look, providing information about whether you are an Indian or not should not be that difficult. Why? You have Indian parents. It is simple as that. Even if you don't have brothers and sisters then you have Indian parents and your parents have brothers and sisters. Correct? Why doesn't anyone in Indian Country know any of these people? This is NOT a cheap shot as you indicated above. It goes to the heart of who he claims that he is. As Suzan Harjo pointed out: Churchill is taking jobs and speaking engagements from real actual Indians and building a whole career on it. Those jobs and speaking engagements should go to actual Indian. Also, Harjo made the point that Churchill's comments are having a backlash and where is that backlash going? On to Indian Country. Look, no one believes that he should not have the right to say what he wants. We all believe in the First Amendment even if it is difficult speech. However, just don't run around and claim that you are an Indian when you aren't and that you personally have been oppressed. Let's say that I am a white person that lives in Kentucky and I attend a Baptist church and my parents came the United States from South Africa, do you really believe that I could run around and write books on Irish experience of oppression in Belfast? No. But that is what he is doing. And you are calling it a cheap shot. It is not a cheap shot. It goes to who and what he is. He is what we call in Indian Country a Wannabee. There is a whole tribe of Indians called the Wannabee Indians and he is the Chief. The people that making the complaints about his fake Indian heritage are not conservatives by any stretch of the imagination either: Suzan Harjo (worked for Bill Clinton), Dennis Banks (Founder of the American Indian Movement), etc. He can say wherever he wants about 9/11 or America, but he shouldn't lie and claim that he is an Indian when he isn't. And schools like the Univ of Colorado should do a better job of doing there homework when they hire a someone and put out to the world that he is an Indian because he isn't.Keetoowah 17:45, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)\"\n",

And on November 30, 1864, there occurred near Grahamville the battle of Honey Hill. For Beaufort District, it meant the beginning of the end. \n",
      "Many stories of this battle have been told and written. An authentic and complete account was written in 1899 by Captain Ben Williams, of Brunson, who was a participant, was then adjutant of his regiment. His articles were published in the News and Courier and in the Hampton County Guardian. \n",
      "Outnumbered five to one, a little band of South Carolina cavalry, infantry and Citadel cadets faced a Federal naval expedition which had advanced up Broad River and disembarked at Boyd’s landing (or Salvesberg, the local name). The enemy’s destination was Grahamville Depot; their real objective the destruction of the railway track according to Sherman’s orders. \n",
      "With seven guns, a well-built breastwork, and the superb strategy of Colonel Charles Jones Colcock, who commanded the Third Military District of the state, the little Confederate band inflicted on the invaders losses amounting to nearly 8oo in a few action-packed hours. Colonel Colcock was everywhere, according to other officers. He even enlisted a strong, blowing wind on his side, having his men to fire a field of broomstraw, so that the flames were hurled into the faces of the enemy at a critical moment. Reinforcements of Georgia Reserves arrived from Savannah hours later, under General Gustavus W. Smith, but the general refused to take over the actual command from one whose ability and success had proved so outstanding. Tales have been told by many elderly local people of the surrounding roads literally running with Negro blood, because more than half the Federal force was made up of Negro regiments trained at Hilton Head. \"\"You could walk on dead Negroes for miles,\"\" they declared. Old manuscripts tell further of bodies hastily buried in trenches; of later washing rains exposing a gruesome welter of arms and legs. These bodies later received decent burial in the Federal cemetery at Beaufort. \n",
      "An interesting side light on this battle is the fact that a local Negro, Allen Orr, participated. (He was proud of his service on the Confederate side). As a teen-age boy he went into this battle in which so many of his race were slain, \"\"Went with a white friend to take care of the horses.\"\" He lived until a few years ago. At the age of 100 years-plus, he enjoyed giving a pantomime of the manner in which he dodged behind the breastwork as the bullets were flying. The breastwork is evident for all to see. A number of cannon balls have been excavated at the site.\"\"\"\n",

In my eyes it undermines your position as an impartial arbiter and reflects upon your reputation. Overall in my view your handling of the matter has been so far lacklustre at best. You practically admitted that your decision to block me was made on impulse (you initially put a wrong reason as grounds for the block). It seems you are concentrated on watching me while turning a blind eye on how I am being treated. When one of the accusers calls me an 'unfortunate fella' and you choose to ignore it, am I correct to assume that I can also call my opponents 'unfortunate fellas' or you as a watchdog will block me for another 'personal attack'?  I think your last remark is absolutely unwarranted. \"\"Please stop telling people not to post here\"\"? I was not telling I was asking and very politely for that matter, as I do not want my talk page to be turned into an incoherent pile rather than than what Wikipedia creators intended it to be. I think your popping up like that and commenting a minor post of mine looks like another impulsive decision unworthy or an administrator, and also comes dangerously close to what may be interpreted as open bias and prejudice. I kindly ask to get off my back - you really need not be there, I am not such a loose cannon that scrutiny of every little post of mine would be justified. I perceive such excessively close 'guidance' as pressure, and I will act accordingly if I feel your actions contradict your status of an administrator. This is not a threat - it's a statement of my position and my intentions if such treatment continues.  \"\n",

      "Let's start from the beginning and move towards what we have. There was a boy who was born in 1805 who founded a religion. That in and of itself isn't that special. Lots of people started their own religions and churches. But he is different. He isn't just any religionist because he claims that he actually speaks with God face-to-face like prophets anciently. He claims that he received Golden Plates and he translated them by the power of God into the Book of Mormon. He claims to hold the keys to salvation. He claims that his is the only church that acts with real authority from God, and that all the other churches are imposters. Aren't you interested in what arguments have been made about whether or not he is a real prophet? If Joseph Smith merely claimed to be able to predict a few things, that would be one thing. But when a young boy claims incredible visions and revelations, comparable only to a handful of previous prophet's experiences, that is something else.  30 June 2005 00:45\n",

The IBGE estimation came from the census on religion, but many Spiritists do not consider themselves Spiritism \"\"followers\"\", because it is not a religion.  Another poll made by a established poll research institution in Brazil shows that half of Brazilian population believes in reincarnation. Once Buddhism and Hinduism are almost non-existent in Brazil, it shows the strong influence of The Spiritist Doctrine and other native believes in Brazil. Moreover, in another poll (Rede Globo Mineira, 2000) in the populous State of Minas Gerais, Chico Xavier, the most popular spiritist medium in   Brazil, was elected the Mineiro (Minas's citizen) of the century, competing against other popular celebrities like the former President Juscelino Kubischeck and inventor Santos Dumont. Recently Epoca Magazine comments an statistic of 20 to 30 millions of spiritists in Brazil.

Hills probably do make up most of the rest of the reason (at least besides the fact the probably no one really made it a goal).

      "Rough Consensus on wikipedia is about balancing arguments against consensus not policy. So on one hand we had keep votes arguing against an inherent notability that didn't have a policy background and a delete side that was arguing that the subject did not meet the GNG/inclusion guideline because the sources were inadequate. The sources brought up in the discussion did not seem to meet the GNG so I was left with policy based arguments to delete and non-policy based arguments to keep. That gives a rough consensus to delete. I'm always happy to userfy. Where would you like it.  Humbug! \n",
      "Fully disclosing my biases toward keep on this issue, I agree with  that you made an erroneous decision on this one. I'm no admin, but the debate appears fully in the midst of no consensus, which as you well know, in deletion discussions, normally results in the article, page, image, or other content being kept. I find it confusing that you would say that the keep votes didn't have a specific policy foundation in mind when I specifically and intentionally addressed WP:BASIC as the guildeline (particularly because this was a bio) and then listed a recently published book, black belt magazine, and (least but not irreverently so) the BJJ heroes biography as sources which achieve this guideline. If, for whatever reason, you find the more prime WP:GNG to be the true standard of retention for this article, well I see no reason why it does not equivalently square with nor meet the standards set forth in WP:BASIC. I say this in due respect sir.   \n",
      "I'm a bit confused BASIC is a simplification of the GNG, Please can you explain which sources are suitable to determine notability in this case? Thanks,.   Humbug! \n",
      "Good sir, I'm a bit flummoxed as to what it is about the glut of sources that ISN'T particularly suitable for you. Is it the \"\"Significant coverage\"\" or some other such sub-section of the GNG specifically? I believe that this source would have more than met that. I mention WP:BASIC specifically because this is (was) a biography and BASIC pertain to biographies specifically. Most critically is the section: \"\"If the depth of coverage in any given source is not substantial (as many of these sources admittedly were not), then multiple independent sources may be combined to demonstrate notability, which the at least dozen or so sources DID in a non-trivial manner. Now I know I'm not a administrator, and I don't have the permissions nor presumably knowledge to adjudicate these affairs, but I do casually work on more than enough bios to know that when the majority of all biographies (take this as an example) are FAR less cited and left kept or otherwise unmolested clearly there is a double standard in effect here.   \n",

      "Hi, my thinking has been that those stub tags do not necessarily imply nationality, and just sorting them into subcategories - The changed wording when moving into position tags (the decades just add a clause onto those) could be a problem, but the phrase \"\"English football forward\"\" is a bit ambiguous in that sense. This seemed reasonable as the idea of a stub tag, as opposed to regular categories is not to categorise people, but to group them for interested editors, so if all we know about someone is that they played English football, that is the obvious place to stub-sort them. I certainly don't have a problem with the alternate wording you mention, although I notice it has been reverted for consistency on one of the pages linked. I would be happy to go through and change all of those if there is consensus for that wording.\n",

      "The thing is that Saying that the Vedas permit beef-eating and cow-slaughter amounts to striking a lethal blow to a Hindu’s soul. Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,. But, due to the rise of dilettantism fused with a plethora of societal changes, influence of external cultures and severe lack of awareness about real Vedic injunctions, the role of religion has withered over the years.\n",

My basic point is that if the article mentions Obama's mother's single Scottish ancestor (who was born 400 years ago), as well as Obama's Irish and Swiss ancestry, then there shouldn't be a problem with an equally-brief mention of her African ancestry. My one-word addition to the article was first modified and then deleted, so I opened a talk page here.  The discussion has taken a disturbing turn, and seems to have hit a nerve of racial discomfort among some wikipedia editors.  In particular, the suggestion to delete the entire list of ethnic origins as a way to avoid adding the word \"\"African\"\" strikes me as a potential public relations black eye for wikipedia, which is why I am making this post here.  \"\n",

I consider Max Van Sydow to be a very respectable actor but it's almost like they sedated him, took his soul and left him with one expression, he's like a zombie as Jesus. The film had me yawning all the way through and I genuinely had to check myself several times from shutting off for a kip! Never a bright moment, nothing to lift the mood, even the silly cameos in it. It's not that the film, the scenery or whatever is bog standard or dreadful, but its the way the scene are compiled and the lifelessness of the actors in it which make it exceedingly dull and uninspiring to watch. David Lean was apparently an uncredited assistant director on it which I find hard to believe. Uncredited perhaps because of sheer embarrassment with the result. I'm not sure how anything in which Lean so much as touched ended up that dull... I just saw Treasure Island (1972 film). Welles was perfect casting as Long John!

      "P.S. On further reflection, I see that there is at least one point that I clearly overstated in our discussion. Sources for 2000s (decade) do not, in fact, have to be explicitly about the decade. They can be about, say, events that happened at some point during the decade. For example, a retrospective source about the 21st century, published before 2010, almost certainly is acceptable as a source about the 2000s. It is, after all, from these types of sources that time lines are constructed. Beneath my cynical tone (as it strikes me now in retrospect) was the idea that one can't infer too much from sources, as such inference might amount to original research. If a source says that X is characteristic of the 21st century or of modernity in general, that source (at least in principle) certainly may be used to help put the 2010s decade (insofar as it is part of the 21st century and of modernity) into context. Statement X just shouldn't be used clearly to characterize item A on Wikipedia, when it clearly is meant to characterize item B in the source. This probably is what I should have said back in January, and I apologize for making my case in such an inflected voice. Also, I take it that your first language is not English, so I should have been more sensitive to the possibility of unintentional offense. While I don't know for a fact that you took offense at all, I'm troubled by the correspondence between our discussion and your departure from the project. Please, once more, accept my sincere apologies for any actions on my part that might have discouraged your participation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "What you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth's contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always \"\"100% correct and 100% according to policy\"\" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)\n",
      "\n",
      "I and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it's not getting far. That's not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I'm sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand's characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don't waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn't go amiss - if ordinary admins aren't bothered about this particular user's return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), \n",
      "\n",
      "Betacommand's clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105\n",

So, here is some information for you: User:Daicaregos, First edit: Apr 21, 2008, Unique articles edited: 533. User:Pasquale, First edit: Jun 24, 2004, Unique articles edited: 1,461. As you can see, I've been on the Wikipedia for five and a half years. And, yes, I always use \"\"Show preview\"\" function.\n",

      "Look, if I could vote for Welsh independence tomorrow, I would do it. I'm all for it. Ditto for all the other unrepresented nationalities. But what I can't stand is when people take their nationalistic battles to the Wikipedia. Is Wales one of the United Kingdom's constituent countries, whether one likes it or not? I noticed you did not remove that part, so I must conclude you agree. But you chose to remove the flagicon and referred to that particular edit as \"\"tidy\"\"! (Again, very funny, not to mention a little tricky.) Well that flagicon is also shown next to England and Scotland in the List of country name etymologies, so in order to \"\"tidy\"\" up the whole article you should remove it in all three places!

      "Hi Pasquale, ydw. Dw'n siarad Cymraeg, diolch. I've moved your reply here for two reasons. 1. to keep it in one place. 2. to remove the union flag from my talk page (and you call my edits tricky and disingenuous). Glad you enjoyed my joke. I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found \"\"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as \"\"removing edits [you] just don't like\"\" and as a \"\"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response\"\".\"\" Which seems justified. It remains to be seen how you deal with the apparent inconsistency in the article. Hwyl,   \"\n",

There are, however, some obvious problems with the article's current text. Several statements are unsourced or improperly sourced, and editorial opinions and recommendations are given. I don't think there can be any justification for including editorialising like \"\"The unfortunate history of the genus now came to play\"\" or leading statements like \"\"The reader can decide for themselves whether the issue here is 'science' or just 'politics', and whether there is any solid factual basis for rejecting Wells' name for this taxon\"\". We can only repeat or report what the sources say. In this case, we can state for instance that Georges and Thomson (2010) concluded that Wells' publication did not fulfil the criteria for publication under the ICZN, and that they disputed whether \"\"W. dorsei\"\" warranted recognition as a separate species. I have seen similar cases elsewhere, with statements like \"\"this constitutes a valid publication under the ICZN[1]\"\", where the citation is to the ICZN itself (which naturally doesn't mention the case in question) – this is to my mind obviously unacceptable. On less contentious issues, how many species are there in the genus? We learn that the \"\"genus currently contains five [...] species\"\", but only four are listed. I would also recommend removing the Wikispecies link until it provides complementary information, rather than a blank contradiction.

England is a more definitive location, and if it's linked in the article, anyone who didn't know, would quickly find out that England is part of the United Kingdom. Someone earlier said UK is a bit daft because you might as well say Cornwall is in Europe, and I agree with this. England is the next biggest unit up from Cornwall, so it's natural to relate the one to the other. Apart from anything else, Cornwall, United Kingdom just sounds peculiar (maybe because no-one ever says it).   \"\n",

I would not go so far as to call the article a \"\"quote farm\"\" of course but the Critical reception section comes close. I also see the article as serving as a vehicle for panning \"\"all things Scientology\"\". Example, featuring the ridiculous rumors spread by anti-Scientologists such as the alleged subliminal messages. Example, the entire Controversy - Scientology sub-section that leads off with an OR interpretation that there was something controversial about the rights holder, Author Services, and continuing with undue emphasis to further invented controversy based on scant and clearly biased sources, mainly two anti-Scientologists, Bunker and Wollersheim. In actual fact all we have is a pet project of Travolta that was produced by a questionable character (not a Scientologist) and that was a big flop. The rest is invented controversy. I do not think this project, as an encyclopedia, needs unduly forward invented controversy, let alone invent more.   \"\n",

      "\"\"Bösendorfer has a reputation of excellence at piano making. Moreover, German-speaking countries such as Austria have a tradition of excellence at anything related to solving complex engineering tasks. And lastly, Austria is in Europe and the way products are advertised in Europe is much more honest than the way they are advertised in the USA (features of products mentioned by European companies are nearly always true contrary to what happens in the USA!). Consequently, there is no reason to doubt that the features that Bösendorfer mentions on their web site concerning this new CEUS Computer Grand Piano will prove to be true when they will be assessed by independent parties.\"\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, here is the new, latest version of my article; it should pleased even the worst complainers and prove that I am with no agenda at all!!\n",
      "The New (2006) Bösendorfer Reproducing Grand Piano: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano\n",
      "During the past recent decades, a reproducing piano (also sometimes called a computer piano or a player piano) has been defined as being first an acoustic piano that is not diminished in any way in its ability to play piano pieces. The touch at the keyboard and the sound produced by a reproducing piano is not changed in any way compared to a normal acoustic piano. However, a reproducing piano has an unobtrusive computer interface that allows the pianist to record and playback the piano pieces that are performed on it. Usually, it also has a silent mechanism that stops the hammers from striking the strings and that allows the pianist to play silently at the keyboard, at any time during the day or the night without disturbing others, and with the option of using headphones to hear digital sounds while playing silently at the keyboard (many digital sounds are available: piano, harpsichord, organ, strings, etc.). It also has a MIDI interface that allows the pianist to play back many pieces that are available on this particular MIDI format. The capability of a reproducing piano to convey the full expressiveness of the pianist at the keyboard is directly related to its ability to record and playback accurately the velocity of the hammers that are moved when the pianist presses the keys at the keyboard. However, the MIDI format allows the recording and playback of the velocity of the hammers of the piano only at a level of accuracy of 127 scales (or 127 steps if you prefer). The problem is that most of the pianistic techniques move the hammers at an incredibly high speed, making these 127 scales highly insufficient to be able to record and playback accurately the very high velocity of the hammers. Consequently, a reproducing piano usually also has a more accurate proprietary format to record and playback piano pieces at a much higher level of accuracy than the MIDI format. In summary, a reproducing piano is a very flexible musical instrument that combines the old (an acoustic piano) with the new (a MIDI format but especially the recording and playing back of the piano) at the same time. It allows the pianist to play the numerous MIDI piano pieces available but, more importantly, to record and playback piano pieces at a higher level of accuracy than it is possible to do with the MIDI format.\n",
      "\n",
      "The quality of the Bösendorfer pianos and especially the sound that they produce are the result of a long and old tradition of piano making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bösendorfer also kept in touch with modernity. They took an active participation at making reproducing pianos first with their SE 290 computer piano that was made in collaboration with Wayne Stahnke. It was considered by the entire community of piano makers to be the most accurate reproducing piano of its time.\n",
      "At the beginning of 2006, Bösendorfer introduced its next generation of reproducing pianos: the CEUS Computer Grand Piano.\n",
      "\n",
      "Previously to the Bösendorfer CEUS Computer Grand Piano, several scientific studies were made that had for main goal to assess if the reproducing pianos that were available were as faithful to the expressiveness of the best performers at the piano as they should be. These studies concluded that the best reproducing pianos (including the SE 290 computer piano) were not as faithful at recording and playing back the performance of the best pianists as they should have been (see in particular \"\"Measurement and reproduction accuracy of computer-controlled grand pianos\"\" by Werner Goebl, et al., August 6-9, 2003).\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this conclusion as an incentive to raise the accuracy of its reproducing piano (the SE 290 computer piano), Bösendorfer set themselves to create an even more accurate reproducing piano that would accomplish THE VERY CHALLENGING GOAL OF BEING ABLE TO RECORD AND P\n",

In any event, your subjective assesment, heavily influenced by your personal opinions on the subject matter, of whether AmRen's view of race is \"\"worthwhile\"\" or \"\"base\"\" or whether the piece's writing is \"\"high quality\"\" is not sufficient grounds for removal.  You will simply have to tolerate the occasional link to an article you disagree with, even strongly.  I will restore the link soon unless given an convincing reason why not.  \"\n",

I've played since the original set was out and its hard to find a 'GOOD' checklist on the internet, at least one that tells everything about everything from all the way back and includes all error and promo info too. And don't lay some crap on me that the more recent sets have a bigger importance. Also I swear I saw a whole page about the Base Set not to long ago. Did one of you delete that?? Why might I ask did you delete that?? If you tell me its just taking up space, well I think theres thousands of pages on wikipedia like that. If someone trys to delete one of the new pages i will make, ill be more than happy to get some admin's on here to sort out your opinions on this. The bottom line is that there should be some sort of detailed database that emcompasses ALL pokemon cards in ENGLISH that have been made. You can't find one of those on the internet today, so why not have one on wikipedia i ask you? And who are you to decide what is appropriate for wikipedia anyway? hows this raw source material anyway?? Look at any band or comic page. Thats alot of info isnt it? Also I dont want to start a whole site, I think wikipedia serves that purpose already for alot of reasons.\n",

      "@Shmayo I already know the map from John Speed, but this far away from being an evidence that the Suryoye/Suraye called themselves Assyrians or considered the ancient Assyrians as their ancestors. The \"\"Deutschen\"\" don't call themselves Germans (Germanen) or Alemanes (Alemannen) in their native tongue and it's not the first time that the word Suryoye/Suraye was mistranslated into \"\"Assyrian\"\" by outsiders:missionaries and colonists. Do you have quotes or chronicles from Nestorian Christians BEFORE the 19th century and in their OWN words, which shows an ethnic Assyrian continuity? The Syriac-Orthodox Church has quotes and chronicles which goes hundreds of years back, where they equate Suryoyo with Oromoyo in their OWN words. Interestingly, the Arameans from Maalula who are either Christian Melkites or Muslims call their Aramaic language/dialect also \"\"Siryon\"\" or \"\"Loghtha Siryanoytha(Aramoytha)\"\", which is a result of Greek-Christian influence on the Arameans. The word Suryoyo, which literally simply means Syrian in English is rather a religious term similar to Maronites, Catholics or Melkites. Nevertheless words can change their meanings in course of history. Even if the word Suryoyo derives from Assyrian ot doesn't change the fact that the Arameans where also known by this name.   \"\n",

The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time!

      "I see that Jughead has added a pretty nifty graph which represents all known oldest people at a given time from 1830 to the present date. But I can see a few problems right off the top - for one, the chart should start from 1955 which is really where the record starts in any substantive manner, as that is when the record started to be kept and subsequently amended back to. While we may be able to compile a list of oldest people going back into the 19th century, besides the fact that patchy birth records make such a compilation somewhat meaningless, any compilation beyond what already exists on this page would be original research. \n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, it is hard to really understand what the graph represents, with a lot of tiny dots. Close clusters of dots really represent  the fact that record-holders held the title briefly, a low cluster means someone held the record for a long time. Which was only really true after 1955. The chart implies that Betsy Baker who is represented by the dot circa 1955 held the record for a whopping 25 years, which is obviously not so. And thirdly, the current record-holder just turned 115, yet is shown as being 116.\n",
      "\n",
      "My suggestion would be to keep the vertical axis as is, but to create a bar graph for individual years of BIRTH starting with the first record-holder Betsy Baker's birth year, 1842, draw a bar for the maximum age attained for any person born in that year and do the same for each year up to 1892, the most recent birth year for which no people are proven still alive. And this would not be original research, as there is a page with this list: . There is someone for each year save 1845 there.   \n",

Selznick, and Daniel L. Oshea, Selnick's Assistant Secretary. Then you added that Entwistle played in bit parts in several films (I'm paraphrasing), and referenced a source. But this claim of bit parts in other films proved to be untrue when I researched the entire body of RKO's inter-office memos at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences archives in the Herrick Library in Beverly Hills.

      "President Obama appeared before constituents of Eric Cantor's congressional district to press the Congress to pass his bill immediately. On September 12, he gave a speech in the White House Rose Garden in front of a group of teachers, police officers, construction workers and small-business owners in which he stated that \"\"if Congress does not act, just about every family in America will pay more taxes next year. That would be a self-inflicted wound that our economy just cannot afford right now.\"\" In Speaker Boehner's home state of Ohio, Obama gave a speech described as \"\"fiery\"\" in a Columbus high school that led to the audience chanting: \"\"Pass this bill!\"\" In a campaign-style rally at North Carolina State University, Obama told college students \"\"Every single one of you can help make this bill a reality. … The time for hand-wringing is over. The time for moping around is over. We've got to kick off our bedroom slippers and put on our marching shoes.\"\" At a black-tie dinner for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, Obama pitched his jobs plan to Latinos. In anticipation of criticism that the legislation was motivated by the upcoming election, the President noted that the election is fourteen months away and that Americans do not have the luxury of waiting fourteen months for jobs to be created.\n",

We could even take off the final sentence that is there now, and I could incorporate via some other measure.

      "Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.\n",
      "\n",
      "All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.\n",

      "I have proved time and again that the corrections I make are 100% accurate and verifiable. I have gone out of my way to provide detailed information on sources and where those sources can be located. In contrast the sources quoted by Jdorney are not only dubious, but are not at all supported by the majority of authors and historians. Jdorney uses two main sources...CAIN and Lost Lives. CAIN is a \"\"estimation\"\" at best, and the US State Dept. Jane's Intelligence, British  Human Rights Watch, the Council On Foreign Relations, and various books and articles...all take issue with CAIN's facts and figures. As for Lost Lives, I have the latest edition of that book, and Jdorney completey fabricates the figures. If one reads carefully from 1969-2005, they see the number given as 86, shown as the amount of UDA and UVF members killed by IRA and INLA units. 85% of that number are given credit soley to the IRA. I wonder if jdorney even has the book, since he misquotes it so often. Similar numbers I have provided as to the number and units of British and Irish killed by the IRA is similarly backed up by Lost Lives...if one actually takes the time to read it throughly. I am not going to respond to any more whiney, and childish messages by jdorney. I have informed Wikipedia staff about his biased and unprofessional behavior, and have recieved back that Wikipedia will look into it. It is sad that Wikipedia has to be hampered by a few biased, purposely innacurate Editors, who ignore facts and make up their own...just to support their own one sided views.\n",

It is reasonable and moderate to rely on facts instead of conjecture. PRT does not exist in revenue service anywhere in the world. Any claims about PRT are merely conjecture, not fact.  Any comparisons between PRT and other proven modes of transport is meaningless, unless the purpose  is to mislead. What I have successfully proven in print and on the internet is that many PRT advocates use \"\"facts\"\" based on conjecture that PRT can out-perform conventional, existing modes of transport to argue that public funding for transit is wasteful. You can see that for yourself in this video made by a PRT advocate.. One PRT \"\"fact\"\" often repeated by advocates in public meetings is that PRT can pay for itself out of fair-box revenue - you can hear that in this video and this video.

      "The ravings written above by Kimberly Williams would probably be considered evidence of some form of emotional or personality disturbance by most people. The claims she makes above lack credibility. The link to Williams' own web site simply contains more of her unfounded rantings. Williams seems to understand so little about Wikipedia that she does not understand that Andrea James is NOT the author of the Wikipedia biography about her. The information about the colleges  Andrea James has attended and her degrees from them are well known and easily verified facts. The other facts in the Andrea James biography are also easily verified. There is no requirement that Andrea James provide documentation about the biography of her to Wikipedia editors. If Ms. Williams were at all credible, it would be her responsibility to produce notarized letters from Wabash College and the University of Chicago that Ms. James did not receive degrees from them. Ms. James is a well known author, film maker, and activist whose laudable efforts are well documented. Ms. James activities are also well documented by national magazines, newspapers, and television appearances. Ms. Williams has no such credibility. The evidence is clear, from Ms. Williams infantile response above, and her infantile behavior on Wikipedia and elsewhere on the internet that her beliefs are the product of some form of delusion on her part. Kimberly Williams does not appear to be someone with any intention of providing an appropriate contribution to the Wikipedia.\n",

I like those terms because they shock the conscience in that everyone knows what those terms mean with regards to Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. It was the passage of the so-called \"\"Race laws\"\" of the 30s that led to the Holocaust of the 40s - there was a cause and effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now with that preface out of the way I am stating that the 1215 Magna Carta contains the smoking gun of England's own move to rid the Isles of the Jews. This is not hidden history but well documented history. It is just not talked about because the English (I am English) don't want to be thought of as being antisemitic, but English history reeks of antisemitism.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is not being addressed here (and even less now that someone has added the censor's touch), is that the Pope of Rome (there were other Popes), controlled England through his king; church and law (there was no secular law as such that was not santioned by the Church and the Church was the one Church based in Rome. I hope everyone knows about Henry VIII so that I don't have to explain that as well.)\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Jews were moneychangers. Why were they moneychangers? Go and do your own research! You need to know. The Jews had a moneychanger relationship with the Church and that is why the clause is in there: the Jews were (are) not Christians (duh!) - not members of the Church of Rome. The Pope gave them special status. The representative for all of the wheeler-dealing was the Archbishop. The barons were merely local gangsters, or in today's understanding = warlords (thugs.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The statements about the Jews in Magna Carta was not intended to educate readers as to who the Jews were - everyone knew who the Jews were. They were the People of the blood libel (\"\"they killed Jesus\"\"). The Church whose Jesus the Jews killed put up with them like the Nazis used Jews when it suited them and some Jews (a few) went along with the Nazis to save themselves at the expense of the majority of Jews. This is the thorny issue we are dealing with. Under English law the Jews were forbidden to do practically anything else but be moneychangers! They were the scum of society and the Church had a need for a sub-class of human beings. The Jews did not have the same status as everyone else and the Jews were murdered and abused. Because of the holier than thou attitude towards ethnic cleansing in the world today, the English do not want to admit that they were at it long before Herr Hitler got into the business!\n",
      "\n",
      "Now move along to 1297 and \"\"bingo!\"\" = no Jews. Why? Because they were kicked out of England, forced to go underground or convert. Same thing happened in Spain. (Hello, isn't that what happened in Nazi Germany?) It was not until the time of Cromwell - long after Henry VIII told the Pope bye, bye and long after Shakespeare wrote his own infamous words about a moneylending Jew that Cromwell talked about religious tolleration. Why? Because Cromwell ruled the English Republic which had severed its relationship with the Church by chopping off the head of the king; abolishing the House of Lords and raiding all of the Church properties to put them out of business. Then the forces of the Republic went to Ireland and engaged in \"\"ethnic cleansing\"\" by wholesale murder and mayhem.\n",

What we have here on Wiki right now is pure boring propaganda that explains nothing. But by looking at the clauses dealing with the Jews you can see that while the English may get on their high horses and yell about the evil Germans (remember the UK Royals are German are hiding under another name since WWI), then it is possible to gulp and say \"\"me too\"\" (in English) and understand that evil knows no race or religion.  16:12, 18 Dec 2004 (UTC)\"\n",

It's somewhere in between.  It's a remake with add ons.  If Yamagishi wants the remakes to feel like two totally different games, then why don't we treat them as such until we find out otherwise.  This is even MORE TRUE for First Departure.  How on earth can First Departure be a direct port of Star Ocean when it has the Star Ocean 2 battle engine?  According to these entries and some other news I've read, it seems that both of the remakes have a fair amount of new things.  Being a tri-ace fan since 1998, I'd advise you probably just wait.

Anyway, I suggest that you consider simply dropping your current user name, adopting a new one with no references to external identities and continue editing as before under the new name. You should not make any kind of link between them on-wiki, but equally it would be imperative that you privately communicate the link to AC and assure them that you intend to respect the restrictions applicable to your current name while they are in force.  Assure AC that you reject the imputations of proxy-editing in the past and give them your assurance that you will be sure not to do anything of the kind in the future.  Make it clear that you would regard continued oppositional research and linking your old and new usernames on the pretext of finding or holding evidence on-wiki as harassment.

The 2000 census info itself may not be current, but I feel that the growth of the city is relevant to the subject - certainly the growth rate of a city is a useful piece of information? I understand the argument that colored text is not acceptable because of color blindness. I was simply copying what was found in the Colorado municipalities article. I do not know enough about how the tables work to do it in a more acceptable way myself, but I would ask that the population change information allow to be included - if the color of the text were black then I don't think that information alone would keep it from remaining a featured list.\n",

While it may be argued as reason for general economic inefficiency of the USSR during its later years it is completely out of place as a reason for space exploration setbacks in this article. First of, it was precisely the central planning that made Soviet space program possible. Without centrally allocated resources and planned activities it would never see the light of day nor would it be able to compete against a similar space program undertaken by the wealthiest nation on the planet. Secondly, the US space program (or any large technological program, Manhattan Project being such an example) is equally 'centrally planned', financed and controlled. Very little if anything is left to the works of free market forces. Similarly the US space program has its own also sadly impressive list of setbacks and disasters.

      "The subject homophobia and the definition of the term homophobia are not the same thing. The subject of homophobia is (in short) the fear or hatred of gays, or discrimination or prejudice against them. The AFA is a recognized part of a body of groups, people, and ideas that define modern-day homophobia. There's no way you can deny that, even if you believe that the label is undeserved, that the label could be pejorative in a non-encyclopedic context, or that somehow being categorized under \"\"homophobia\"\" and being an organization somehow equates to being categorized as \"\"homophobic organization.\"\" The categories \"\"homophobic organization\"\" and \"\"homophobe\"\" were deleted because they are, grammatically, constructed to specifically modify or describe the subject in question. \"\"Homophobia\"\" is not, and these false analogies may make it seem like we're out go get the AFA, but we aren't. Although Sam seems to think it's an irrelevant personal comment, it is the case, Hal, that since you got here, you've been arguing that the AFA's opinion of itself should more of a part of the article, and that criticism should not be. Miles have been spun about how much of a big deal this is, that we're gay activists, that we're creating attack articles, that the category homophobia is a pejorative attack on whatever it labels. Now, Sam, I know you'll insist on removing this part of my comment (editing/censoring others' comments is a practice that is, by the way, fairly dubious). But remember that we are supposed to discuss the issue at hand, not the character of others - I'm not attacking Hal's character. But his history of editing for the sake of the AFA is completely relevant to this discussion and a part of the issue at hand - it explains why he believes we've constructed an attack article (hardly), why the category is a pejorative attack or accusation (clearly not), and why it must be eventually removed. I agree with Hal: it could be taken as a pejorative, and what concerns me is that it is, but only (as far as I can tell) by someone who's made it clear that portraying the AFA in a positive light is very important (no matter [[WP:UNDUE|what that entails).  \"\n",

I can only hope that, whatever doubts you had, they are now allayed. As I have mentioned on other occasions, I have no connection to Mr Langan, am not a proponent of his ideas, am not a proponent of ID, and only know of Mr Langan through the media (particularly the Errol Morris program).

      "I have been to several Larouche meetings and I find it very interesting that the Larouche Movement advocates that we non-members are conditioned by fear (especially baby boomers) not to join their fight when on the contrary they use nothing but catastrophic speculations as recruitment. Larouche has been propagating perpetual nuclear warfare and the collapse of the economy for decades. I have personally been told that I would work at Starbucks after my degree (I have a well paying successful job today), the economy will collapse within a year (this was told to me a few years ago), and I was shown pictures of soldiers being hanged referring personally to my faith if I had not joined their fight to stop it. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, by joining this movement, members take a leap over all their earthly problems by being placed in purposeful positions to save the world and receive immortality of the soul in return. Which depressed kid would not want to be placed into that fantasy world. The lonely recruits receive brotherhood; the ones who have failed in life are given intellectual reverence surmounting any non-larouchie, that’s a good opiate receptor! Many of these recruits come into the movement as empty slates to be filled up with Larouche tactics, this is why the Larouche YOUTH Movement has been the biggest sector in their existence. This is also a reason Larouche recruiters blatantly challenge their contacts not to listen to their parents, professors, or any adults with the explanation that they have become forever impudent by fear through degenerate cultures that us kids still have a chance to overcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "1) They believe in aristocracy, as their beloved and foundation, Plato does. It's interesting how their cause is to invest in the potential of every single human mind when their political system would be setup to discount and make decisions for the non-aristocrats, which would be us weaklings. And before one of you fresh Larouchie's claims this is not true, it had been recorded in a briefing. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) They want you to drop out of school because classes are setup as a 1-way channel between teacher and students, rather than, a pedagogue where everyone can facilitate the exchange of diverse ideas. I find this most interesting when i was accused of being a British operative in my attempt to exchange the ideas of philosophers and economic theories they were never exposed to. During a meeting my questions were brushed off and not answered, the speaker called them ‘academic’. The Larouche Movement is so organized that he has already conditioned his youth to negate any wake-up theories or opposing ones to be that of British conspiracy against mankind. In conclusion, this is no place to exchange ideas as they preach it is, it’s exchanging Larouche ideas or nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Larouche writes thousands of pessimistic speculations, and when one inevitably hits, he is plumed to be always right as the others are forgotten. The speculations that are forgotten are thrown under the umbrella of economic collapse and perpetual warfare with only the future to hold the truth. Just read Larouche writings, he tells you that he is the ONLY ONE in the WORLD who can save us from these disasters. His intent and cause seem great, but what does his character tell you about the underpinnings; his Will to Impose himself on others? It is so blatant that even the purblind can see the egotistical style in his writings, remember, this is called the LAROUCHE Movement. \n",
      "\n",
      "4) Larouche recruiters insult your way of living opposed to the thinkers, the ones who spend their time developing their minds in the movement. If the Larouchie’s are our saviors, if they are the brains of our renaissance, or even the brains of the world, studying Larouche mathematics, science, literature, philosophy, politics. Well how come none of the members ever made an invention or real impact. They really can use some invention to boost their popularity and finances. The reason this has not occurred is a great irony; these members are not self thinkers, they are followers, they study only Larouche and even with that knowledge they are too conditioned for Larouche to make new inferences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "All this studying and organizing only embeds the shackles on their minds. It is very unfortunate, because these members truly become psychologically stuck in the movement. It is very hard for one to admit to the Self that all these years were a waist of time and they must now step back to the miserable status of earthly life they left off at. This, accompanied with the fact that these members breathe Larouche 24/7, is why they will and are stuck beyond all fathomable realizations of the world.\n",

I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The \"\"do not edit the archive\"\" notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been \"\"slandered\"\" (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP.

It are simply facts. Most parties in Europe are Anti-EU, but even if not, why would that be a reason not to mention the parties who speculate about withdrawal?? And why would non-winning in elections be a reason not to mention them?? They seek EU Withdrawal or a major reform or opt-outs for their nations.

Second, all that would give WP a very bad name, which you don't wanna, though it has anyway a bad name yet as WP is a non-neutral center-left pro-EUSA propaganda platform. But you may be right with the fact, that the party-lists are already better explained in the article Euroscepticism (while \"\"Euroscepticism\"\" is also rather a pro-EU valuating name, better would be \"\"Eurocriticism\"\" or \"\"Anti-EUism\"\") which would but not be a reason to delete the lists, but to delete this whole article and simply redirect to Euroscepticism and transfer the other information.

Would a low intellect on ArbCom help or hinder? If there is evidence (a diff) of intellectual failings, does the candidate realise this failing? Can he explain it as something other than an intellectual failing? The questions were politely put. They were challenging, and they were meant to be, and anyone in the community (which includes me) has the right to ask candidates challenging questions on their past performance.

Jewish Law is administered and enforced Judaic Lawin Israel and in the Diaspora through Bet Dins (Houses of Judges) Judaic Law holds that the man must initiate the request for the Jewish Divorce (\"\"get\"\")and the woman must agree to receive the (\"\"get\"\").\n",

      "The relationship between state and religion\n",
      "\n",
      "Jewish law or religious law is not justiciable in societies with the civil law doctrine of separation of Church and State which can sometimes cause conflict for women who remain in \"\"agunah\"\". One of the most common divorce difficulties is that a spouse can be held in a limping marriage when the other spouse refuses co-operation in the religious form of divorce (see Agunah). A civil divorce can be obtained through local courts which entitles the parties to remarry civilly, but the capacity to remarry is also religious question. Where one party has the power to grant or withhold a religious divorce, this power can be used as a bargaining tool to pressure the other party to agree more or less favourable terms for residence and contact with children, and for maintenance and property settlements. Such provisions produce a conflict between the human rights of the woman to be free to marry and the freedom of people to practise their religion (see Article 18 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights which is repeated almost word for word in Article  9(1) European Convention on Human Rights, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief).  The difficulty is that most countries operate under constitutions based on a separation between church and state which forbid governments from interfering in the practice of religion within their territory unless the behaviour of one or more parties is in breach of the local civil or criminal law. Thus, for example, in Rhodesia, the case of Berkowitz v Berkowitz (1956) (3) SA 522 (SR), held that it was inappropriate to use contempt proceedings to force a husband to grant a get because anything concerned exclusively with religious formalities was outside the jurisdiction of the secular courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the majority of Western states do, to some extent, make the secular court's response to matrimonial proceedings conditional on the relevant party taking the steps necessary to complete a religious divorce on fair terms, so that either the court will impose excessively generous orders for maintenance and property settlement, or deny access to a civil decree or to ancillary relief until the religious formalities have been completed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, following consultation with all major religious groups, the Divorce Act was amended in 1985 to add Section 21.1 to give the courts have the power to dismiss any application, and strike out any pleadings and affidavits filed by a spouse who has failed to remove religious barriers to the remarriage of the other spouse. The legislature intended to:\n",
      "place spouses on a more equal footing in civil divorce actions;\n",
      "encourage women in particular to exercise fully their rights under the law; and\n",
      "maintain the integrity of the Divorce Act 1985 by helping to ensure that refusing to accept or to give a religious divorce was not used as a bargaining tool to gain unfair concessions on child custody and access, or monetary support. \n",

      "The description of hazel eyes says they're green and brown (either colour could be dominant) and can also contain gold, this description is incorrect, true hazel eyes are a golden honey brown colour (basically light brown) which matches the colour of a golden brown hazelnut shell (hence the word hazel), however in some instances can contain minimal amounts of green (either on the outskirts and/or mixed in with the gold) when observed in direct/sun light, but green is by no means a requirement for true hazel eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is common in North America aswell as areas of the world that have been exposed to Americanisation, However in Europe (the origin of light eyes & hazelnuts) the correct meaning still exists and is used when identifying eye color (hazel eyes = golden light brown colour). The myth of hazel eyes being green and brown or any multi-coloured eye is likely to of started due to green and brown eyes turning a gold and/or light brown colour in areas of dim lighting and actual hazel eyes sometimes presenting slight green when observed in direct/sun light, but this is nonetheless an obvious misconception which requires common sense to understand.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for green and brown eyes they're well green eyes that contain contain central heterochromia (brown around the pupil) but this does not change the fact of their true colour being the outer green, if you want to categorise them differently the name Forest Green proves worthy or just simply green eyes with brown.\n",

      "Hi GroverTheGnome, Here's a suggestion that can help you. Why not write your articles temporarily on your user page (or subpages). They don't have to meet Wikipedia's notability requirements. And when the subject becomes notable you'll be able to rename (\"\"move\"\") them to the titles you want. It's an easy way to get around the requirement for notability. So don't worry, you can still write the article on this subject and have it on Wikipedia, just in a different place. I hope that suggestion helps. Best regards  \"\n",

The behavior he exhibited was pure paranoia and hysterics as I see it, and others have agreed, and he also is accurately described as someone who continually deleted cited and relevant material from Wikipedia despite mine and others protests, as well as all comments made by him and myself that showed his own incivil behavior. That is why I have reproduced the exchange on my talk page as it has been deleted from where it originally occurred with only my YouTube post left intact. I wonder why he did that? My remark above contains nothing profane and represents my view of his outrageous behavior and was placed nowhere but on MY OWN TALK PAGE.

Also, as someone who is part of the LGBT community and has been intimately aware of AIDS and those with it since the early-80s, I can tell you that \"\"resentment\"\" isn't really accurate.  Look, I've known more than 100 friends who have died from the disease - at least 2/3 of them dying in the 1980s; the remainder in the early to mid-1990s before the drugs got better and more effective over the long-term.  There was a time when I was attending multiple funerals every month.  I still know a good number of men who remain HIV positive but have somehow stayed alive with the disease for more than two decades.  I can testify as a first hand-witness that it wasn't \"\"resentment\"\" people in the gay community were feeling, it was anger.  And certainly not because of Ryan White's openness of what it was like for someone outside the gay community to contract the disease.  The anger was directed largely at the US government as well as those who insisted that those who did get sick and die, died because of who they were and were being punished.  Ryan White and Elizabeth Glaser put a new face to AIDS, most certainly, but I know of *no one* in the gay community (and as someone who is actually a part of the gay community, I think I would have a better perspective than someone who isn't no matter how close they think they are/were to those in the queer world) who felt \"\"resentment\"\" over the attention AIDS received after their AIDS diagnoses became public knowledge.  If anything, the gay community and those with HIV/AIDS within the gay community were elated that something was now going to be done, while skeptical it might be short-lived and/or selective, yet still quite angry that when it was a \"\"gay disease\"\", it wasn't important enough for the POTUS to acknowledge.    \"\n",

I cannot help reconstruct given I deny there was a revolution, but only help with accurate historical and logical analysis of the (non-revolutionary) developments in the centuries of interest. The main problem of standard 17th century revolutionism for mechanics is essentially Duhem's deconstruction of alleged key developments of the alleged 17th century scientific revolution into the 12th to 14th centuries that essentially still stands. Perhaps details of that should replace the final 'literary criticism' section you removed ? Anyway, article's surely in an appallingly confused 'nowhereland' state at the moment.

As for keeping great power status to this day, I'm sure that that should come as great surprise to the French, humiliated by Nazi occupation and resolutely defeated both in Vietnam and Algeria.

The large number of editors who have reverted the editor over the past four years is clear evidence of the objections. And now, Dennis is finally acknowledging that I am right on the content issue.

      "Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;\n",

      "I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3.

I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz\n",

I didn't dare pick it up solely with the 'end' (what should I cal that?), for fear of breaking it, and it's night now, so I'll do more outdoor experimenting tomorrow. But I could pick it up while supporting the bottom. A bit wobbly, but no problem. Of course condoms have to be of quite good quality, for their orginal purpose. I havent tried drinking the water yet, though. Shoud be ok though, because the spermicide is on the outside only. And I don't know where I might get condoms without spermicide. I'll be visiting my outdoor store, Demmenie, one of these days, and then I'll ask. This much handling causes sticky hands, though. And hard to wash oof too. Normally I only handle condoms lightly with my finger tips. But more experimental info tomorrow.\n",

      "A translation of Babasaheb's Marathi speech delivered at Indian Merchant's Association Hall on 25th Sept.1932 regarding Poona Pact and published in the issue of the \"\"Janata\"\" on Oct. 1 1932, and excerpted from \"\"Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar - Writings and Speeches Vol. 18, Part I, pp. 368-369\"\": \"\"When I think about my difficult situation few days before and today's happy moment I consider it as a dreamlike moment. On the one hand I had to save the life of Mr. Gandhi; on the other, I had to protect the legitimate rights of millions of my fellow untouchable brothers with the full value of my life. I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy. On this occasion I do not hesitate to give credit to Sir Tejbahadur Sapru and C. Rajgopalachari besides Mahatma Gandhi for the success of this Pact.\"\" (Source: http://buddhambedkar.blogspot.com/2011/07/poona-pact-and-its-agreement.html)\n",

There is no problem to build a transistor with more than Emitter or with more than one Collector and in fact these transistor variants really exist. A multi-basis transistor would be a transistor with one Emitter, one Collector and more than one Basis. I cannot imagine how this should be made. It is thus more likely that people use e.g. two transistors in a specific way that would allow to compensate the noise. This is how the basic idea for the bipolar transistor has been discovered by Herbert Mataré in 1942 while he was working on a Duodiode that should allow to compensate the noise in a mixer for a 3 GHz Radar receiver.

      "Hi, another few points about the second subtitle: \"\"Would the preparations have been effective?\"\".  I argue that this subtitle is too long. The subtitle \"\"Historical analysis\"\" would be more concise. As well, professional historians do not usually devote time to \"\"counter factual\"\" discussions, like \"\"Would the US forces in Hawaii been able to withstand an amphibious assault by Japanese forces in WW II\"\", or \"\"If it had not been rainy in 1415, would the French knights have won at the Battle of Agincourt, rather than being trapped in the mud\"\".  Historians don't spend time discussing these issues. In 1415, during the battle of Agincourt, it WAS muddy, and so the French knights DID get bogged down in the mud, and so that is the course of the battle.

And that's where I'm not sure on where would I be allowed to place the evidence. Not after the response, I guess, but would it be admissible all the way to the top, right after the words of Sanguinetti? Or somewhere in the middle? Or does it also depend on the kind of sources I find? Also, still supposing I find good material disproving these sayings, does it affect the possible neutrality of the article, or is this considered a minor detail? I'm not trying to get specific answers for this, but maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I just wouldn't like to start adding information in a misguided way, which would end up with me asking stuff here anyway...\n",

      "\n",
      "Principle II – Empiric – The fulfillment principle: \n",

      "The Life Scale is directly proportional to the Space Scale. As smaller the Space Scale of an Entity as small it is the respective Life Scale of that Entity. \n",
      "Nature clearly shows that there is a relationship between Life Scales and Space Scales – the empiric observation demonstrates that the absolute life time of a planet is much longer than of a human. And the absolute life time of a human is much longer than of a butterfly – so, there is an evident empiric relationship between Time and Space that we humans never saw and took into scientific consideration. \n",

Only using the imaginary complex number i=(-1) ½ it is possible to mathematically define that imaginary dimension from the World Scale where we do belong. \n",

The Entity only can make that justification if he is capable of creating a mathematical model where the sky color dimension is introduced as an imaginary dimension i=(-1) ½. \n",

As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, \"\"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?\"\" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).\n",

      "I see that you have had what must be an unencouraging start to editing Wikipedia, with several articles you have created being deleted, and others replaced by redirects to existing articles. My advice to new editors is that it is best to start by making small improvements to existing articles, rather than creating new articles. That way any mistakes you make (which you will, because we all do) will be small ones, and you won't have the discouraging experience of repeatedly seeing hours of work deleted. Gradually, you will get to learn how Wikipedia works, and after a while you will know enough about what is acceptable to be able to write whole new articles without fear that they will be deleted. Over the years I have found that editors who start by making small changes to existing articles and work up from there have a far better chance of having a successful time here than those who jump right into creating new articles from the start.

At that point in time, the Marx generator, which stores energy in capacitors, was the only device capable of producing such high power pulses. The prohibitive cost of the capacitors required to obtain the desired power motivated the search for a more economical device. The first Magneto-explosive generators, which followed from the ideas of Andreï Sakharov, were designed to fill this role. \n",

Various uses of this similarity can be found in this article by J.-P. Petit..\n",

      "\n",
      "This flux conservation can be demonstrated from Maxwell's equations. The most intuitive explanation of this conservation of enclosed flux follows from the principle that any change in an electromagnetic system provokes an effect in order to oppose the change. For this reason, reducing the area of the surface enclosed by a conductor, which would reduce the magnetic flux, results in the induction of current in the electrical conductor, which tends to return the enclosed flux to its original value. In magneto-explosive generators, this phenomenon is obtained by various techniques which depend on powerful explosives.  Other techniques exist which do not depend on  explosives. Notably, see  : Flux compression scheme used at the Gramat centre of study, in doctoral thesis, Mathias Bavay, 8 july 2002.\n",

(Note that I didn't like the catalyser argument: the magnetic field is highly dynamic, and in a sense consumes the reactant (the initial kinetic energy), even though the flux is conserved, unlike most chemical catalysts, which act mostly just to bring together the reactants in the correct configuration. A closer chemical analysis would be something like electron transport in photosynthesis, perhaps, but that really doesn't add anything useful to the discussion). \n",

There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.

One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.\n",

      "I sincerely believe that we really need to lay down the law in stub sorting, and really provide a guideline.  I believe that we should all attempt to reach a general consensus by April 2, 2005 in a set of rules that we can follow.  Once we have built a set of guidelines, we can formally create a policy out of those guidelines.  We need to define what a specialized topic stub is, how many articles it should cover, when is it appropriate to create it, what defines its need for its creation, what defines its need for deletion, what criteria it should follow, what are the general steps should one take when sorting a stub, whether or not to start using subst: for all templates, whether or not use subst: for all templates created by the meta-templates, and any other matters that may come up in consideration.  I thank  for initially creating the subpage for the project at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  Even though they have been discussed, I feel that we really need to confirm everything.  For that, we should discuss each issue with its own sections, and raise a list of issues that we need to nail down before really continuing on.  The English Wikipedia is nearly at 500k articles.  Either the MediaWiki software needs to handle stubs such that they can be found with a simple union of categories, or the sorting is done manually by Wikipedians.  Personally, I think the latter is less taxing on the server load, especially when we use subst:, which I think would help the Wikipedia out, performance wise.  Please make your comments at Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject Stub sorting/Guidelines.  I apologize for making this somewhat of a spam notice, but since the project has more members, the project can finally decide on these important issues at hand.  (talk) 23:23, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)\n",

The information is not solely from that site, it is also from this one.  I have created a solution to this discussion.  The wonderful thing about Wikipedia is that these changes can always be removed if a concensus is not reached.  As the current concensus is at a stalemate I have taken the appropriate actions.  I am in discussions with regards to the possible copyright infringement, but seeing as Lostpedia currently has no copyright guidelines, I agree this may take some time.

      "The film makes several suggestions that V is blind and benefits from enhanced senses like Marvel's Daredevil. When he emerges from the fire, Delia says he looked at her, but not with eyes, as he had no eyes. Obviously he seems to have no eyes behind the mask, but the citizens wearing the mask throughout the film also have no visible eyes. This could be a screen behind the mask for style purposes, although shots of V putting on the mask show that it has no screen behind the eyes and mouth. V does seem to be wearing a skimask/hood behind his mask, though. In the scene where V is disguised as a police officer and kidnaps Evey, he is wearing a burn prostethic behind the ski-mask and if you look closely, he seems to have large blacked eyes, similar to Hellraiser Cenobites. In the scenes where V emerges from the burning ruins of Larkhill, the closeup of his face also reveals his eyes to be \"\"black\"\". Also while in disguise later as Brookewood(or whatever), he is wearing a pair of shades. This could be for one of two reasons: To disguise his black/missing eyes, or to make rectal identification impossible. \n",

      "\n",
      "So, giving some considerable weight to doubts about his guilt would be justified.   \n",
      "\n",
      "That is true, but it stands that he is a convicted mass murderer who took the lives of hundreds of people. To have the majority of the article weighted towards his alleged innocence/appeals etc seems disproportionately biased in his favour. While I know that there is obviously a distinct article on the bombing, it doesn't quite seem appropriate that the article about the guilty party is leaning heavily towards innocence. In light of the dropping of the appeal, it seems somewhat unlikely that he will be exhonerated, so it's not even as if Megrahi's status, in a legal sense, will alter (in terms of innocent vs guilty, rather than incarcerated vs free). I'm not sure what to do to alter the article, which is why I tagged it, to see if anyone else had any ideas. I accept entirely what you're saying, and I even agree, I just, like I said, find that focus disproportionate.   \n",
      "\n",
      "This legal speak is very cautious. \"\"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred\"\" means in reality that it is practically certain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. So, he is convicted, yes, but a mass murderer, no, the guilty party, no, most likely not. Concerning the future, nobody knows, but there remains a strong pressure to reopen the case.213.84.53.62  \n",
      "\n",
      "My understanding of the legal status is that \"\"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred\"\" does not, by any stretch, mean that the occurrence of such a miscarriage is \"\"practically certain.\"\"  If you have evidence to that effect, I would be happy to see it.  It only means that there is sufficient reason to justify the time and expense of further investigation.  We should also be wary of political pressures on the relevant actors in this case, coming from both directions, and to me this diminishes the weight of several quotations in favor of al-Megrahi; there was significant pressure on law enforcement agencies to put someone away for the Lockerbie bombing, and just as surely there was just as much pressure on Libya and its friends to exonerate him, due to the sanctions and damage to international reputation and etc.  This is why I think less weight should be given to quotations and more weight to the hard evidence. \n",

      "Perhaps the article would read a little less biased if it actually included some of the relevant points from the original case against him? It doesn't really tell a reader why he was convicted in the first place.-12.70.92.162  \n",
      "\n",
      "I absolutely agree.  First, the weight of the evidence in favor of a conviction should be given.  The page says nothing about what he is accused of doing and why the judges reached the conclusion they did.  Second, even though reasons have been given to doubt the conviction, responses to those reasons should also be given.  Presumably those who remain convinced of al-Megrahi's guilt, especially those who were involved in the initial trial, have offered responses to the allegations of a miscarriage of justice.  Al-Megrahi was convicted; this much is fact.  Voices should be heard that believe the conviction was wrong, and voices should be heard that believe it was right.  It is partly the absence of this secondary response that gives the article a prejudiced feel to me.  \n",

      "Having read the entire article, I must agree with Sky83 and 12.70.92.162. How many times is the phrase \"\"miscarriage of justice\"\" used here? There is actually very little information provided to show a miscarriage of justice took place (One of Hans Koechler's reason for doubting the validity of the conviction: \"\"A retired Scottish police officer has signed a statement confirming that the evidence that found Al-Megrahi guilty was fabricated.

      "Hi, thanks for your comments, they will definitely be helpful in getting the article to a point where it's appropriate for more general audiences and not just trained linguists. To answer some of your specific questions:\n",
      " fómhar has [u:] in some dialects because the rule that mid vowels are raised to high vowels before nasals (including the formerly nasal mh) applies to ó in many dialects. This reminds me that I didn't discuss that raising in the article at all, so I'll add a new section about it presently.\n",
      " F and bh/mh/v are often pronounced with the bilabial fricatives  instead of the labiodental [f, v]. Unfortunately, the published sources aren't very specific about when which versions are used. The same is true for palatal vs. palatovelar (not that there's a huge difference between the two in the first place  any individual speaker probably uses both interchangeably without even hearing a difference)\n",
      " Sometimes the standard orthography does a very poor job of representing a particular dialect's pronunciation of a word. In the dialect I got the info from, scanradh happens to be pronounced as if spelled scamhradh. The pronunciation of cam is /kaum/ per the discussion of lengthening/diphthongization before fortis sonorants.\n",
      " Exactly how the fortis and lenis sonorants differ changes from dialect to dialect, as I tried to show in the chart. There isn't one unified pronunciation of the two types.\n",
      " Images of the vocal tract like the one you link to are fine for consonants, but not much use for vowels as the differences between nearby vowels are too slight to be easily seen in them. Also, they belong more on the pages about the sound in question than in this article.\n",
      " I'm sorry if your heart sinks at the word \"\"largely\"\", but this page really isn't intended to help you get from spelling to pronunciation. (That's what Irish orthography is for.) This page is for describing how Irish is pronounced by native speakers, regardless of the spelling. The realizations of sh are also discussed at Irish orthography, though some discussion of the alternations between [h] and [ç] would probably not be amiss here.\n",
      " I'll see what I can find about stríoc. There's no epenthesis when cn gn is pronounced cr gr, because epenthesis is found only in Munster, and cr gr for cn gn is found only outside Munster.\n",
      " \"\"...[at abstract level] vowel-initial words... all begin with either a front or back glide that triggers either palatalization or velarization... Is there a way to determine what is being triggered in each particular case?\"\" Well, from the orthography, yes (if it starts with e or i, palatalization is triggered; if it it starts with a, o, or u, velarization is triggered), but from a purely phonological point of view, no. It has to be included as part of the lexical information of the word.\n",
      " \"\"Alternation\"\" in the table refers to the fact that some forms of a word (e.g. the nominative case) have one sound (e.g. a long vowel) with other related forms (e.g. the genitive) have another sound (e.g. a short vowel).\n",

Ludwig von Mises obviously had similar ideas, but no one has really done the \"\"hard\"\" financial modelling on this Austrian School theory, and tried to collect long-term historical data, tracking changes in debt levels over time and compared this to volatility levels (the frequency and severity of so-called \"\"black swan events\"\") in financial markets.  My hypothesis is that with increasing margin lending and debt levels, you will see bifurcating bell curve returns (i.e. extremely high returns or extremely negative returns, with few data points in the range of the long term mean during these periods of heavy net indebtedness).\n",

      "I'm just curious, especially because I've been seeing several editors doing this, but why would you change \"\"Evanescence.com\"\" to \"\"www.Evanescence.com\"\" (as you did here), when the former is a perfectly valid link to their website and is much more visually pleasing? —  (t @ c) \n",
      "\n",
      "The infobox doc has the standard format as \"\"www.example.com\"\" and the Official link at the bottom of the page was directed to www.ev.com so I followed that pattern as well.  Also, as you mentioned, most other pages have the www. on there as well. Most of the time the reasoning is because when visiting the domain without the \"\"www.\"\" subdomain, it redirects to it with the \"\"www.\"\" anyway.  Apparently this is not the case with the Evanescence website (as I have just verified).  I was really just looking for consistency, though.  Since the Ev pages all had \"\"www.\"\" listed, I kept it consistent by making the infobox the same.  I agree that Evanescence.com looks better.  However, all official channels such as their official twitter page (as well as Amy Lee's official twitter page), the official youtube page, and even the WindUp records website links to \"\"www.Evanescence.com\"\". I believe that we should follow suit. ~ [ Scott M. Howard ]:[ Talk ] ~ \n",

      "Okay, that's fine. For most any modern website, the \"\"www\"\" is almost completely redundant, and I personally loath such things, but it really makes no difference for our purposes here. The infobox doc makes no sense to me with that \"\"standard\"\", since IIRC http:// and https:// could technically direct viewers to two different websites, so why not require that part as well? Feels like over-standardisation. —  (t @ c) \n",

Secondly, Kanzi is supposed to understand 3000 spoken English words (that's according to the wiki bonobo article, which references (guess what) the same Raffaele article we're talking about), so why does S-R need to use the lexigram at all ?\n",

As I have mentioned here and elsewhere, Petrarchan47 has been engaging in this behavior - going on the Talk pages of users he/she believes are sympathetic, and making these kinds of unfounded accusations against me and other editors, for quite some time, and I have had it with being bad-mouthed.   That is one issue  the other one is the more garden-variety of canvassing about specific article content.  I am not even editing or watching the MaM article, as I already was fed up with Viriditas' behavior there.

      "re: (My talk) First off: please don't get mad at me for what I say below. I say it in good faith, and most likely a naive view.It seems to me that you're going about interwiki-linking to the other wikimedia sites in an overly complex way. Wouldn't something along the same style as the inter-language wikipedia links (i.e. in the bar on the left of the page) be far better, and much more elegant? Not only would it reduce the amount of clutter on the page, it would also remove any issues with categories being named differently as the interlanguage links deal with this as a routine matter. Additionally, there are a number of bots that would be able to propagate these interwiki links (i.e. you'd add one set of links on, say, Wikipedia, and a bot could propagate them to all of the other sites).\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see two issues with this: 1. it requires developer changes to the mediawiki code, 2. it's not possible to use tracking categories. Hopefully the first one of these shouldn't be too difficult to arrange, and if inter-wikimedia-ing becomes popular, I think that the benefit of the tracking categories is fairly minimal. ... or am I misunderstanding what you're doing? The above works nicely if you're just linking similar templates together, and even if you're making sure that they have similar functionality. However, if you're making sure that all of the templates _are exactly the same_, it's not so good. In this case, a system like that used at Help:Link would be better - having a single master copy (the best place I can see for this is on the meta), which is then copied over to all of the mediawiki wikis every so often. That copying could be done by a bot, say every 24 hours, with the template being flagged for human attention if it's been modified anywhere but on meta. Of course, extra care would then have to be taken if the template calls were modified.  ''\n",

      "Mike I be putting this whole section in WT:TSP, but the short answer is first that I concluded last fall this belongs on Meta, and much of our 'good stuff' is already there and many of our best template programmers contribute there as well (Omegatron, CBD, etc.) But here people know me and so this is where it began. Like David, RL called (demanded!) and I went wiki-missing much of last fall, and was busy with mediation stuff when I first returned to having regular time for wiki's, then iterwikitmp-grp hit Tfd... so that boot in the rear restarted things. I'd really rather be working on categorization between here and the commons! Sigh... life is not a selection of first choices, most of the time we're lucky to be able to get one selection in our top fifteen!  I'll address your points on WT:TSP. But thanks for the interest and input. I like that idea of intersister interwiki's! As for 'What I'm doing', the WP:TSP has new revision that may help communicate the focus as I see it. This is really a local need as much as one off in the smaller sister's though Wikispecies and Wikiversity much need template expertise and libraries.  ttfn // nkB \"\n",

Please check out what many other editors have said about her and then tell me if you still think so. Sorry I cannot sit back and watch you trying to equate us.

Only people who think that they can win or accomplish something are passionate in what they do. I'll talk straight and pull no punches. I made my comment on your page only to show you that Tiamut is lying, in the belief that maybe you’ll open your eyes. Tiamut hasn't gotten under my skin at all; I know what she is up to and want to stop it; but if you (not you necessarily) will try to stop me instead of her, then I'll bid all of you good bye and let you have what you deserve. I have no softer way of putting it, that I just can't take this crap that Tiamut thought it reasonable to add \"\"nation\"\" to the opening paragraph. No, she knows exactly what she is doing and such comments are what lets her get away with it. While Tiamut has lost her temper many times; I haven't lost my temper even once; disappointed, yes; lost temper, no. You say that you're surprised that Tiamut didn't go to the talk page earlier; I wonder why you're surprised; don't you see that she first tries to get away with whatever she can, then she'll engage in talk with no intention of compromising but to get part of her pushing accepted and put off the rest for another round. You say that I started my conversation with a negative touch by its heading of POV pushing. My purpose is not anymore to set her straight, which I have already given up. My purpose is to point out her POV pushing to all of you. Actually I think that I'm treating her with kid gloves compared to how administrators would have dealt with her, if they only wanted to. Lastly I completely object to your equating us both as edit warring. When one side explains, but the other side says one thing on the talk page and does something else on the article; then the explainer shouldn't be labeled an edit warier simply to be able to play the equation game. Please get it straight; I am an honest editor and she is a POV pusher, and the twain doesn't meet. She needs to be admonished not mediated; you cannot mediate with someone who will only play the game of mediation with no intention of good faith editing.\n",

Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only \"\"real science\"\" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since \"\"displacement current\"\" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing \"\"displacement current\"\" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it. Catt has quoted Davidson as (in effect) calling the Telegrapher's Equations \"\"absurd\"\" because they model a TL as a capacitor, when Catt & Davidson know that a capacitor is a TL. [Electromagnetics ch6]. Although Catt would undoubtedly claim that the equations describing the TL are based on experiment they are, in fact, derived from the Telegrapher's Equations in the first place.
